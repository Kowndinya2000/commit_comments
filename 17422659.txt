    install joypad header
    added new JoyPad driver and testprogramm for it
    
    The new JoyPad driver tries to fake the behavior
    of a joystick, so that it can work as a drop
    in replacement for the joystick
    reworked Sliderbox driver
    
    changed interface, so that the return value of pollNonblocking
    now indicates if there is still a valid packet. The new argument
    updated indicates, if the values of the sliders/buttons changed.
    
    reformated source

    dist: remove dead cmake code

    move the definition of RawCommand here
    
    It was defined in the orogen component, which made it impossible to

    to other types of commands). Move it here to make it available at
    the library level.
    Removed Joypad class
    
    Jostick should do the same...
    Added test application for spacemouse
    Moved the 3D Mouse plugin to the controldev
