    'Provider' is more correct than 'engine'
    Place paths to main pages in JB hash
    Provide custom overrides to all helpers
    
    Now all helpers can be overridden by custom implementations without editing JB source. Just define a helper's 'engine' as 'custom' in the _config.yml file and provide a helper file of the same name in _includes/custom/. This helps users cleanly upgrade JB versions since they no longer need to edit the files directly.

    Resolve incorrect HOME_PATH/BASE_PATH settings
    
    JB/setup needs to account for  being falsy. Also add better usage instructions for BASE_PATH. Fixes #30

    Provide custom overrides to all helpers

Just define a helper's 'engine' as 'custom' in the _config.yml file and provide a helper file of the same name in _includes/custom/. This helps users cleanly upgrade JB versions since they no longer need to edit the files directly.
    rename HOME_URL to HOME_PATH
    Rename set_paths to more generic 'setup'
    
    This is because 'setup' will need to be included in every post/page file if we want to have access to BASE_PATH. So I figure 'setup' will be a good access path for any future inclusions we need to make
    Add ability to dynamically set url paths
    
    This makes GitHub Pages for projects support possible as all urls will need to call on the project's subfolder. The other important piece is that urls should resolve to root locally but be able to change when in production. LLastly this gives themes clear integration points for working with paths. (the jbcache hack just makes it so there is not unnecessary whitespace output in the source.

    Only list pages with a title. #69
    
    This skips the page.html, default.html, what-have-you-not pages that should not be listed in this list anyway, which otherwise result in empty bullet points.
