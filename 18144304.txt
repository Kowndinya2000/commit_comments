    Typo
    
    Typo in email address.
    Username Error
    
    Minor fix with getting username, added try/except statement to resolve issue and allow banner to work.
    Replace os.getlogin() with getpass.getuser()
    
    os.getlogin() returns null / No such file or directory on a fairly bare Arch system.  Replacing it with getpass.getuser() works fine.
    [bugfix] Fix exception error when xrandr is not installed
    
    - In multi-monitor configuration, banner message was appearing in between
      the monitors. Added fix to default setting to display banners separately
      on each monitor
    - When Xinerama is enabled, xrandr is disabled which was causing the banners
      not to be displayed as an exception occurred.
    [bugfix] use element 0 for the hostname
    Do not print sys-info on bottom banner
    Made font for ESC xx-small.

    Resolution Detection Update
    
    Based on user feedback I was able to figure out some of the problems with the automatic detection using xrandr.
    ESC to hide Font
    
    Set "(ESC to hide)" font to x-small.
    Added ability to hide a window for 15 seconds using the ESC key.
    Added window opacity options for windows for window managers that support it.
    Manually Set Resolution
    
    Fix to the configuration to allow the optparser to work.
    Manually Set Resolution
    
    Added the ability to manually set resolution via 'x' and 'y' variables in the '/etc/classification-banner' config file or via '-x' or '--hres' and '-y' or '--vres' command line options.
    Updated resolution detection method order to better handle newer graphics cards.
    Update classification-banner.py
    
    Updating header information and version to 1.5.2
    Update classification-banner.py
    
    Fix to line 61 - changed grep expression to fix the check for monitor - changed '*0' to '^\*0' at suggestion of Mr. Mark Porter. Tested change in RHEL 5 with xrandr - appears to work and should fix issues with RHEL 5.
    Fix inconsistent format.
    
    * File was formatted using a mixes of spaces and tabs. White space
      is now consistent.
    
    * Fixed a few minor pep8 1.5.7 issues.
    fix some typos
    Update classification-banner.py
    
    Fixed issues with RHEL 5 (monitors-changed method not in RHEL 5 pygtk, added additional RHEL 5 xrandr method). Tested on RHEL 5, 6, Fedora 19.
    Comment Updates
    
    Updated comments on the functions.
    Resolution Fix
    
    Adds ability to deal with dynamic changes in resolution, should fix issue with SPICE client resizing.
    MultiMonitor Fix
    
    Added another check to try and determine the resolution of the default monitor. This is to try and display the classification only on the primary display of the system. Updated version to 1.3.1
    Fixed Indentation
    
    Fixed indentation on the file, caused a python error. Updated version to 1.3.
    MultiMonitor Fix
    
    Using xrandr application to determine resolution of primary display, failback to previous GTK method. This should limit the display of the classification banner to the primary screen of the system in a similar fashion to Microsoft Netbanner.
    Migrated from getopt to optparse
    Convert print to use () syntax instead of spaces for py3 support
    Adjusted to match PEP 8 code style and PEP 257 style doc strings
