    fix minitwit/flaskr test errors, improve docs about file open mode
    
    app.open_resource needs to get called with the correct mode param (python3
    will read bytes [not str] if the wrong mode is used), add mode param docs.
    
    rv.data is bytes, fix the data type we compare it with to be also bytes
    ported some more stuff to py 3.3
    
    removed init_jinja_globals hack from app.py after consulting mitsuhiko
    (didn't work on py 3.3 "as is")
    
    removed with_statement future imports, not needed any more

    Use sqlite3.Row factory in Flaskr
    
    As pointed out in issue #588 sqlite3.Row should be used instead of
    using casting to dict(). Also altered the "Easy Querying" Patterns
    example to include the more correct way to return rows as dicts.
    Did not touch Tutorial examples ("Views"), as these are not up to
    date with the current Flaskr code, and the "Show Entries" section
    points out the "Easy Querying" section on how to convert to a
    dict().
    Updated examples to new sqlite patterns and added new section to appcontext docs
    Updated the docs and examples to non-failing teardown handlers
    Updated examples
    Updated examples to work with pypy which has a incomplete sqlite3 in 1.4.  Also disable a euc-kr test that does not work on pypy
