    Added code to use the commit confirmed feature on the device.
    
    specifying confirmed=30 in commit_config() will automatically revert
    your changes if you loose connection with the device or not do a clean commit_config() within 30sec.
    the commit needs to be done in the same vty session as the confirmed commit.

    Truncate comment length to maximum of 60
    
    Instead of raising an exception, just truncate the comment length to the maximum of 60
    Update error message for commit comment length error
    
    Rephrase the commit comment error to better reflect the limits.
    Fixes #55: Check commit comment length
    
    Raise an InvalidInputError when the commit message is longer than 60 characters, as this breaks IOS-XR.
    Revert "Fixed the syntax error from my pull request earlier"
    Create iosxr.py
    
    revert second commit, because it doesn't work
    use Exec instead of Configuration - Configuration will break xml agent

    pylama error fixes
    adding get_candidate_config() tests
    Changed get_candidate_config to remove everything before 'git add pyIOSXR/iosxr.py  IOS XR Configuration', same as in show commands
    Added posibillity to give arguments on show command, also allowing show commands in config mode!
    Changed layout of command generation and added formal config layout
    Added function to get candidate config loaded into the device
    added comments, check for str and int in object init
    Lock/Unlock on demand
    Added an expect match for Key auth.
    
    It's not perfect, since it only matches on '#', instead of matching on something like 'RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:hostname#', but it's probably good enough, since line 149 already uses this behavior.
    found a merge issue in commit_replace_config and README.md
    updated commit_replace_config to match fooelisa/master
    adding label and comment to commit_replace_config()
    Raise an exception if IteratorID is found in Response object. Iteration is not currently supported by pyIOSXR.
    added function help information about new parameters.
    Fixed inexistent ResultSummary node issue on IOS-XR 5.3.1
    minor edit to use string formatting
    Added a catch for 'The XML document is not well-formed' messages.
    Without this pyIOSXR goes to a timeout if you try to commit a config
     that includes a <, > or & character.
    With this code the __execute_rpc__ function returns a XMLCLIError exception when this occures
    Added code to use the commit confirmed feature on the device.
    
    specifying confirmed=30 in commit_config() will automatically revert
    your changes if you loose connection with the device or not do a clean commit_config() within 30sec.
    the commit needs to be done in the same vty session as the confirmed commit.
    add label and comment to commit
    Added support for adding comments to commits
    
    usage:
        >>> device.commit_config(comment='comment saved on device', label='label')
        >>> device.commit_replace_config(comment='comment saved to device', label='label')
    
    comment and label is optional parameters.
    Code is not hevily tested and does not du any internal validation of user input
    Added posibillity to create a logfile of the communication between pyIOSXR and the router.
    
    Usage:
      1) STDOUT
      from pyIOSXR import IOSXR
      import sys
      device=IOSXR(hostname="router", username="cisco", password="cisco", port=22, timeout=120, logfile=sys.stdout)
    
      2) FILE
      from pyIOSXR import IOSXR
      import sys
      log = open("logfile.log")
      device=IOSXR(hostname="router", username="cisco", password="cisco", port=22, timeout=120, logfile=log)
    
      if logfile is not specified it will default to a None object and disable logging
    add function commit_config_with_label
    raise XMLCLIError if XML agent is not enabled, ERROR: 0x24319600
    Fix to get valid compares when merging
    dump() -> tostring()
    make_rpc_call() should return XML, not an object
    added comments to the proposed method
    replaced expect-method to a static string match to improve performance
    added make_rpc_call()-method to allow napalm to query devices directly using XML
    added TimeoutError and EOFError
    timeout also on ssh connection
    updating comments
    adding expect timeout and prepping for v 0.8
    Improve error catching when executing RPC calls
    Added ability to choose which port to connect to
    Some bugfixes and some error handling added
    that timeout change wasnt a idea
    wrapping up new show command in config context and using it
    dont exec show commands in config context
    updating readme
    added __getattr__, updated help and readme
    updating readme. added replace-diff
    making that config diff a little nicer
    better config diff, show command exec function

    pretty diff
    pretty diff
    turns out I can bulk send this...
    fixed broken rollback
    adding commit replace
    updating readme
    config load, compare, discard and rollback
    ok, half way there: lock, unlock, commit and rollback work
    lets be consistent here
    tested init and connection, looking good so far. pexpect actually has a close and i renamed user
