    * cleanup
    Added desleep to README
    Added detime
    Move CFLAGS variables in README before the make command
    
    If the CFLAGS=-m32 is specified after the `make` command, the command is used exactly as specified on the command line; things like `CFLAGS+=-lpthread` will not work. By putting the variable before the `make` command, the correct extra CFLAGS options were added from the command line. This was tested on Ubuntu 14.04 64 bit while compiling 32 bit shared objects.
    Update README.md
    
    fix typo
    Fixes #20 - change delarm to dealarm in readme
    Add Fedora libini_config_devel & some cleanup
    pro up at make and revamp the build process

    Adding support for sleep function
    desock: add support for getsockname
    desock: exit on shutdown of accepted socket, not on 2nd accept
    
    Fuzzing a single-threaded poll/epoll-based network server using AFL++
    did not work because the server would call accept(2) again before
    processing the first connection and would therefore instantly exit.
    Shutdown on EOF from stdin
    
    This signals the EOF to the receiving side.
    exit on second accept
    enable -Wall and clean up warnings
    
    This enables some _essential_ warnings like `Wreturn-type`.
    Closes #32 - properly use format strings
    Address in accept() can be NULL, check first before calling memcpy()
    Add return statement to accept4() wrapper
    Minor fixup of accept

    Bug fix: Change n to total_n post read syscall
    close stdin on EOF
    Change AF_UNIX protocol to 0, return orig sooner
    
    This reorders the check that the socket is AF_INET or AF_INET6 to be intercepted to return sooner.
    It also creates the stdin/out socket as protocol 0 to prevent invalid protocols being sent to the new socket.
    Add connect()
    Added accept4()
    be more careful -- only intercept INET and INET6 sockets
