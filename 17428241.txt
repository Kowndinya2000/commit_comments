    Cleanup CMake code around libgit2 usage and future-proof it.
    
    Use CHECK_FUNCTION_EXISTS to figure out whether there is
    git_threads_init, and blindly use it if its available. According
    to the docs, it's a no-op if libgit2 is not threadsafe.
    
    For future releases of libgit2 though, we'll need to use
    git_libgit2_init and git_libgit2_shutdown instead, which is also
    added with this patch now.
    
    Furthermore we use configure_file instead of manually adding defines
    to all translation units. This approach is much cleaner and explicit.
    Furthermore we'll only have to recompile those TU's that actually use
    the macros, instead of all, when the libgit2 configuration changes.
    Add libgit2 compile-time check for threads support

    normal mode and vi-mode separation
    
    This changes hides vi-mode behind generic input mode interface, which
    means that internals of ktexteditor no longer depends on vi-mode. There
    are no "if"s and only single one #ifdef. And yes there is
    a BUILDE_VIMODE cmake option now, which enables building ktexteditor
    without the vi-mode.
    
    ==  Why ==
    
    Reason for doing this is the reduction of coupling and removal of those
    "if(viInputMode())" cases.
    
    == How it does ==
    
    There is a new directory "inputmode", where the interfaces are. The
    KateAbstractInputModeFactory is ment to by initialized in KateGlobal.
    The view can then use it and ask it for KateAbstractInputMode instance,
    which it can then use in special places like "findNext" or
    "handleKeyPress", etc. The KateViInputModeFactory now hides KateViGlobal
    and KateViInputMode hides the KateViInputModeManager from the rest of
    the system.
    
    The interface of KateAbstractInputMode is currently in very bad shape,
    but that can be cleaned up easily. Lots of the places are oneliners,
    either changing because there is no KateView::getViModeManager anymore
    or because there are now multiple input modes (and yes, it means that
    adding EmacsInputMode after this would not be that much of a nightmare).
    
    == Notes ==
    
    As for the:
    * relative line numbers - plan is to let IconBar call the InputMode for
      rendering that specific part
    * vi-mode specific config options - they are left alone and can be
      refactored afterwards into KateViInputModeFactory
    * input mode specific actions - I would like to see them in Factories
      only, but that might not play well with the shortcut config UI. For
      now I think it's not important.

    Fix for UTF-16 surrogate pair backspace/delete behavior.
    
    Kate stores it's text in QStrings, which use UTF-16 internally.
    
    Currently in Kate when you backspace or delete key at the end or start
    of a UTF-16 surrogate pair, only half of the surrogate pair will be
    deleted; leaving a question-mark symbol in the editor.
    
    This can be seen by inserting a U+1D43D (Mathematical Italic Capital J)
    code-point and trying to backspace or delete it.
    
    With this patch backspace and delete should work as expected, though
    there is other weird behavior related to 205447 that are not fixed.
    In particular: block selection can look funky, and characters that
    use multiple code-points (such as combining characters) still
    don't get deleted properly.

    Mark KTextEditor::Cursor and ::Range as meta types.
    
    Otherwise, we need to duplicate the registration code everywhere.
    
    Note that this is SIC, as people have to remove their existing
    registration lines, otherwise the code will fail to compile now
    due to duplication of symbols.
    KTE::Cursor & Range: add QTest::toString() specializations
    DocumentPrivate impl, that way we can avoid lots of virtual functions
    more cleanup of API, less hacks to get a view if we only have a document
    Code reformatted using kde-dev-scripts/astyle-kdelibs.

    This caused various crashes in the bracket matching animation and the
    collaborative plugin's popup animations if they affected text near the
    end of the document which was then removed. The fix applied by this

    Fix for UTF-16 surrogate pair backspace/delete behavior.
    
    Kate stores it's text in QStrings, which use UTF-16 internally.
    
    Currently in Kate when you backspace or delete key at the end or start
    of a UTF-16 surrogate pair, only half of the surrogate pair will be
    deleted; leaving a question-mark symbol in the editor.
    
    This can be seen by inserting a U+1D43D (Mathematical Italic Capital J)
    code-point and trying to backspace or delete it.
    
    With this patch backspace and delete should work as expected, though
    there is other weird behavior related to 205447 that are not fixed.
    In particular: block selection can look funky, and characters that
    use multiple code-points (such as combining characters) still
    don't get deleted properly.

    Fix for UTF-16 surrogate pair backspace/delete behavior.
    
    Kate stores it's text in QStrings, which use UTF-16 internally.
    
    Currently in Kate when you backspace or delete key at the end or start
    of a UTF-16 surrogate pair, only half of the surrogate pair will be
    deleted; leaving a question-mark symbol in the editor.
    
    This can be seen by inserting a U+1D43D (Mathematical Italic Capital J)
    code-point and trying to backspace or delete it.
    
    With this patch backspace and delete should work as expected, though
    there is other weird behavior related to 205447 that are not fixed.
    In particular: block selection can look funky, and characters that
    use multiple code-points (such as combining characters) still
    don't get deleted properly.

    add word count statistics in statusbar
    
    This option is disabled by default, because it adds some nontrivial CPU and
    memory overhead, though the implementation tries to keep it as minimal
    as possible.
    
    Whenewer the change in document is triggered, the timer is fired to wait
    for 500ms of inactivity. The trigger is reseted every time the change
    happens so as long as she keeps changing the document every 500ms
    or so, the counting wont stall the editor and her experience.
    
    Longer reculculations are done in batches of size 100 with the help of
    500ms trigger. Which means 10000 lines long document will take 20s to
    compute. Subsequent counting of changes will be much faster because of
    the internal computation cache.

    v0.22.0 is currently not yet released. This is not problem, though,

    KTextEditor is then simply compiled without libgit2 support.

    Use CHECK_FUNCTION_EXISTS to figure out whether there is

    to the docs, it's a no-op if libgit2 is not threadsafe.
    
    For future releases of libgit2 though, we'll need to use
    git_libgit2_init and git_libgit2_shutdown instead, which is also
    added with this patch now.
    
    Furthermore we use configure_file instead of manually adding defines
    to all translation units. This approach is much cleaner and explicit.
    Furthermore we'll only have to recompile those TU's that actually use
    the macros, instead of all, when the libgit2 configuration changes.

    Add highlighting commands
    
    Add the commands 'reload-highlighting' and 'edit-highlighting' to the developer console.
    
    This is a KF5 port of a review request I posted some weeks ago (https://git.reviewboard.kde.org/r/118616/).
    
    The highlighting definition for the highlighting currently in use gets opened when entering the command 'edit-highlighting', and the complete set of highlighting definition gets reloaded on entering 'reload-highlighting' (takes a second or two on my machine).
    
    I thought about a simple caching mechanism based on the mtime of the highlighting definitions, too, but it seems they only get loaded in KateSyntaxDocument::setIdentifier where there is no access to the respective KateHighlighting instance. Caching would require some kind of rewriting that code, then. If you think it’s worth it I could give it a try.

    normal mode and vi-mode separation
    
    This changes hides vi-mode behind generic input mode interface, which
    means that internals of ktexteditor no longer depends on vi-mode. There
    are no "if"s and only single one #ifdef. And yes there is
    a BUILDE_VIMODE cmake option now, which enables building ktexteditor
    without the vi-mode.
    
    ==  Why ==
    
    Reason for doing this is the reduction of coupling and removal of those
    "if(viInputMode())" cases.
    
    == How it does ==
    
    There is a new directory "inputmode", where the interfaces are. The
    KateAbstractInputModeFactory is ment to by initialized in KateGlobal.
    The view can then use it and ask it for KateAbstractInputMode instance,
    which it can then use in special places like "findNext" or
    "handleKeyPress", etc. The KateViInputModeFactory now hides KateViGlobal
    and KateViInputMode hides the KateViInputModeManager from the rest of
    the system.
    
    The interface of KateAbstractInputMode is currently in very bad shape,
    but that can be cleaned up easily. Lots of the places are oneliners,
    either changing because there is no KateView::getViModeManager anymore
    or because there are now multiple input modes (and yes, it means that
    adding EmacsInputMode after this would not be that much of a nightmare).
    
    == Notes ==
    
    As for the:
    * relative line numbers - plan is to let IconBar call the InputMode for
      rendering that specific part
    * vi-mode specific config options - they are left alone and can be
      refactored afterwards into KateViInputModeFactory
    * input mode specific actions - I would like to see them in Factories
      only, but that might not play well with the shortcut config UI. For
      now I think it's not important.

    I thought about a simple caching mechanism based on the mtime of the highlighting definitions, too, but it seems they only get loaded in KateSyntaxDocument::setIdentifier where there is no access to the respective KateHighlighting instance.

    Only POD should be initialized globally. Everything else would need

    for performance, see e.g.:
    
    http://neugierig.org/software/chromium/notes/2011/08/static-initializers.html
    
    Also note that this is a coding guideline in Qt itself for the same
    reasons. Furthermore, most issues where in places that are only
    used by a fraction of our users, yet all of them "paid" for them
    during startup.

    including the fixup commit 9e05c5dff85c52792f1153566afc94e2413ad128.
    
    This code is used like that for years in KDevelop and works quite
    nicely for most cases.
    
    Note that for darker color schemes, this most often results in
    a bit less-intense colors which is not a big problem as colors stand
    out much more against a dark background. And its better than before,
    where you'd end up with hard-coded colors for a bright background
    scheme...
    
    Bright color schemes are not affected, as long as they fulfill the
    conditition of having a lower luma for the background color compared
    to the foreground color.

    Clean up all kateversion numbers according to XML validation
    
    Since KDE 3.0, it is possible to update Kate highlighting files on a per
    user basis using a download dialog in the configuration menu, without
    the need to update the whole installation of KDE. To indicate
    compatibility, there is an attribute "kateversion" in the language
    element of the highlighting files. However, those values have become a
    mess over time.
    
    This patch is a radical clean-up of the kateversion values, setting each
    of them to the lowest possible value that makes sure that compatibility
    is only indicated if the update validates with the shipped definition
    file (language.dtd).

    Make SQL* highlighting files more similar, add comment folding to PL/SQL
    
    The three syntax highlighting files for SQL dialects have evolved over
    time and have started to differ in parts that are actually the same.
    While it is hardly reasonable to put these identical parts in a common
    file, it is probably still desirable to keep them roughly in sync across
    the three files.
    
    This is what the patch aims for with several measures:
    * use exactly the same whitespace and indentation
    * sort <item> and itemData by name
    * use the same XML comments where appropriate
    * use the same order of delimiters

    Clean up all kateversion numbers according to XML validation
    
    Since KDE 3.0, it is possible to update Kate highlighting files on a per
    user basis using a download dialog in the configuration menu, without
    the need to update the whole installation of KDE. To indicate
    compatibility, there is an attribute "kateversion" in the language
    element of the highlighting files. However, those values have become a
    mess over time.
    
    This patch is a radical clean-up of the kateversion values, setting each
    of them to the lowest possible value that makes sure that compatibility
    is only indicated if the update validates with the shipped definition
    file (language.dtd).

    syntax highlighting: remove hard-coded colors and use default styles instead
    Clean up all kateversion numbers according to XML validation
    
    Since KDE 3.0, it is possible to update Kate highlighting files on a per
    user basis using a download dialog in the configuration menu, without
    the need to update the whole installation of KDE. To indicate
    compatibility, there is an attribute "kateversion" in the language
    element of the highlighting files. However, those values have become a
    mess over time.
    
    This patch is a radical clean-up of the kateversion values, setting each
    of them to the lowest possible value that makes sure that compatibility
    is only indicated if the update validates with the shipped definition
    file (language.dtd).

    For syntax highlighting, allow .js-files to start with a shebang
    
    When writing node.js scripts it is common to include a shebang at the
    top, like `#!/usr/bin/env node`, and save it in a .js-file. However,
    the syntax highlighter for JavaScript does not understand the shebang,
    and tries to highlight it as JavaScript.
    
    It is understood as two literal regular expressions (/usr/bin and /env
    node), the last of which is not closed, meaning that the rest of the
    file is attempted understood as part of the last regular expression.
    
    This defeats syntax highlighting for .js-files that start with a
    shebang.
    
    This patch allows .js files to start with a shebang.

    Fix for bug #333156 "PHP Comment not highlighted correctly"
    
    The bug reporter provides a test case:
    <?php
    
    /**#@*/
    echo 1;
    
    This results in bad highlighting, because the @ character eats the
    closing comment marker */, making the following lines a part of the
    doc comment.
    
    While the test case does not make much sense, I have not found any
    other parser that would fail to recognize the doc comment as closed.
    
    It is also plausible to encounter "@*/" for a short moment while the
    user is writing a doc comment, so it is desirable to not expand the
    comment over the whole function for this moment.
    
    Fix it by refusing '*' in a tag name of a multiline doc comment if
    a '/' follows.
    
    Increment doxygen.xml version number from 1.37 to 1.38.

    For syntax highlighting, allow .js-files to start with a shebang
    
    When writing node.js scripts it is common to include a shebang at the
    top, like `#!/usr/bin/env node`, and save it in a .js-file. However,
    the syntax highlighter for JavaScript does not understand the shebang,
    and tries to highlight it as JavaScript.
    
    It is understood as two literal regular expressions (/usr/bin and /env
    node), the last of which is not closed, meaning that the rest of the
    file is attempted understood as part of the last regular expression.
    
    This defeats syntax highlighting for .js-files that start with a
    shebang.
    
    This patch allows .js files to start with a shebang.

    Clean up all kateversion numbers according to XML validation
    
    Since KDE 3.0, it is possible to update Kate highlighting files on a per
    user basis using a download dialog in the configuration menu, without
    the need to update the whole installation of KDE. To indicate
    compatibility, there is an attribute "kateversion" in the language
    element of the highlighting files. However, those values have become a
    mess over time.
    
    This patch is a radical clean-up of the kateversion values, setting each
    of them to the lowest possible value that makes sure that compatibility
    is only indicated if the update validates with the shipped definition
    file (language.dtd).

    For syntax highlighting, allow .js-files to start with a shebang
    
    When writing node.js scripts it is common to include a shebang at the
    top, like `#!/usr/bin/env node`, and save it in a .js-file. However,
    the syntax highlighter for JavaScript does not understand the shebang,
    and tries to highlight it as JavaScript.
    
    It is understood as two literal regular expressions (/usr/bin and /env
    node), the last of which is not closed, meaning that the rest of the
    file is attempted understood as part of the last regular expression.
    
    This defeats syntax highlighting for .js-files that start with a
    shebang.
    
    This patch allows .js files to start with a shebang.

    Clean up all kateversion numbers according to XML validation
    
    Since KDE 3.0, it is possible to update Kate highlighting files on a per
    user basis using a download dialog in the configuration menu, without
    the need to update the whole installation of KDE. To indicate
    compatibility, there is an attribute "kateversion" in the language
    element of the highlighting files. However, those values have become a
    mess over time.
    
    This patch is a radical clean-up of the kateversion values, setting each
    of them to the lowest possible value that makes sure that compatibility
    is only indicated if the update validates with the shipped definition
    file (language.dtd).

    mk: Update how the build deals with version labels. #16677
    
    Adds a new configure flag, --release-channel, which determines how the version
    number should be augmented with a release label, as well as how the distribution
    artifacts will be named. This is entirely for use by the build automation.
    
    --release-channel can be either 'source', 'nightly', 'beta', or 'stable'.
    
    Here's a summary of the affect of these values on version number and
    artifact naming, respectively:
    
    * source - '0.12.0-pre', 'rust-0.12.0-pre-...'
    * nightly - '0.12.0-nightly', 'rust-nightly-...'
    * beta - '0.12.0-beta', 'rust-beta-...'
    * stable - '0.12.0', 'rust-0.12.0-...'
    
    Per http://discuss.rust-lang.org/t/rfc-impending-changes-to-the-release-process/508/1
    Add new keywords (particularly `where` & `virtual`) to editor modes.
    Bump version to 0.12.0-pre
    Update to 0.11.0
    Add the patch number to version strings. Closes #13289

    Since KDE 3.0, it is possible to update Kate highlighting files on a per

    compatibility, there is an attribute "kateversion" in the language

    Make SQL* highlighting files more similar, add comment folding to PL/SQL
    
    The three syntax highlighting files for SQL dialects have evolved over
    time and have started to differ in parts that are actually the same.
    While it is hardly reasonable to put these identical parts in a common
    file, it is probably still desirable to keep them roughly in sync across
    the three files.
    
    This is what the patch aims for with several measures:
    * use exactly the same whitespace and indentation
    * sort <item> and itemData by name
    * use the same XML comments where appropriate
    * use the same order of delimiters

    Added TOML highlighting
    Clean up all kateversion numbers according to XML validation
    
    Since KDE 3.0, it is possible to update Kate highlighting files on a per
    user basis using a download dialog in the configuration menu, without
    the need to update the whole installation of KDE. To indicate
    compatibility, there is an attribute "kateversion" in the language
    element of the highlighting files. However, those values have become a
    mess over time.
    
    This patch is a radical clean-up of the kateversion values, setting each
    of them to the lowest possible value that makes sure that compatibility
    is only indicated if the update validates with the shipped definition
    file (language.dtd).

    [Markdown]: Fix highlighting of hard-wrapped block contexts
    
    This patch fixes hard-wrapped block contexts (blockquotes, numbered and bullet lists) in Markdown not getting properly highlighted: now the whole paragraph gets highlighted instead of just the first line.
    Side effect: with this patch an empty line is needed to change the highlighting context which is in accordance with http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax: “A paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of text, separated by one or more blank lines.”

    BUG: 318969
    Clean up all kateversion numbers according to XML validation
    
    Since KDE 3.0, it is possible to update Kate highlighting files on a per
    user basis using a download dialog in the configuration menu, without
    the need to update the whole installation of KDE. To indicate
    compatibility, there is an attribute "kateversion" in the language
    element of the highlighting files. However, those values have become a
    mess over time.
    
    This patch is a radical clean-up of the kateversion values, setting each
    of them to the lowest possible value that makes sure that compatibility
    is only indicated if the update validates with the shipped definition
    file (language.dtd).

    Make SQL* highlighting files more similar, add comment folding to PL/SQL
    
    The three syntax highlighting files for SQL dialects have evolved over
    time and have started to differ in parts that are actually the same.
    While it is hardly reasonable to put these identical parts in a common
    file, it is probably still desirable to keep them roughly in sync across
    the three files.
    
    This is what the patch aims for with several measures:
    * use exactly the same whitespace and indentation
    * sort <item> and itemData by name
    * use the same XML comments where appropriate
    * use the same order of delimiters

    fix: coloring of CSS identifier references containing a period
    
    This was fixed already in 2012, but overwritten by a later commit.
    CCBUG: 291915
    First try to support CSS3 media queries. I took http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/ as reference.
    I'm not completely sure about the grammar though. In the text it says that after "and" there has to be at least one whitespace, but in the grammer it looks like the space is optional. Also I'm not sure if newlines are allowed between and "and" and "(". I have to investigate that further. The highlighting does not check if a value is allowed for a certain feature. e.g. 123/234 is only allowed for (min-/max-)(device-)aspect-ratio.
    
    Comments are not supported at all positions, where they are possible according to the document
    
    It is work in progress, but at least it is an improvement. If someone tests it on their files, it would be great.

    Remove "AlignedComments" feature from isocpp.xml.
    
    This feature is broken and very confusing to people. We had a

    now again a user was complaining about it:
    
    > Could somebody tell me how blue "//" comment symbols are
    > different from their gray counterparts?
    
    Since this feature depends on the indent-depth and also requires
    indentation with spaces, it should not be shipped with the default
    syntax highlight, which must cope with all kinds of indentation
    configurations.
    
    Increase version number.
    do it the other way around: keep an clean 'ISO C++' highlighting which SHALL NOT CONTAIN ANY NON-C++ STANDARD (or ucoming standard) EXTENSIONS and have per default a 'full-featured' C++ highlighting that MAY contain more extensions like Qt, Boost, ....

    For syntax highlighting, allow .js-files to start with a shebang
    
    When writing node.js scripts it is common to include a shebang at the
    top, like `#!/usr/bin/env node`, and save it in a .js-file. However,
    the syntax highlighter for JavaScript does not understand the shebang,
    and tries to highlight it as JavaScript.
    
    It is understood as two literal regular expressions (/usr/bin and /env
    node), the last of which is not closed, meaning that the rest of the
    file is attempted understood as part of the last regular expression.
    
    This defeats syntax highlighting for .js-files that start with a
    shebang.
    
    This patch allows .js files to start with a shebang.

    Update Kconfig syntax highlighting: add new operators from Linux 4.2

    Tristate Logic.

    REVIEW: 125312
    syntax: make code folding in choice blocks in Kconfig files more convenient
    
    config blocks in choice blocks are usually indented. Technically, the
    whitespace before an indented "config" line belongs to the config
    block above (if there is any). However, that means when folding a config
    block, then the next "config" line will be hidden which is unintuitive,
    surprisung and inconvenient.
    
    For example when considering this:
    
    choice
            prompt "example choice block"
    
            config CONFIG_0
                    bool "config 0"
                    depends on SYMBOL_0
    
            config CONFIG_1
                    bool "config 1"
                    depends on SYMBOL_1
    endchoice
    
    it is possible to fold the CONFIG_0 block, but afterwards it looks like
    this:
    
    choice
            prompt "example choice block"
    
            config CONFIG_0
                    bool "config 1"
                    depends on SYMBOL_1
    endchoice
    
    which is confusing, because now there is the header line of CONFIG_0 and
    right below the content of CONFIG_1.
    
    Fix this by adding the whitespace to the corresponding lookahead. Now
    after folding CONFIG_0 it will look like this:
    
    choice
            prompt "example choice block"
    
            config CONFIG_0
            config CONFIG_1
                    bool "config 1"
                    depends on SYMBOL_1

    Clean up all kateversion numbers according to XML validation
    
    Since KDE 3.0, it is possible to update Kate highlighting files on a per

    the need to update the whole installation of KDE. To indicate
    compatibility, there is an attribute "kateversion" in the language
    element of the highlighting files. However, those values have become a
    mess over time.
    
    This patch is a radical clean-up of the kateversion values, setting each

    All syntax changes up to Linux Kernel 3.15 are incorporated. There is
    some rough documentation in the file. File extension is "Kconfig*"
    
    The configuration system is also in use by many other projects (e.g.

    BUG: 334686
    Clean up all kateversion numbers according to XML validation
    
    Since KDE 3.0, it is possible to update Kate highlighting files on a per
    user basis using a download dialog in the configuration menu, without
    the need to update the whole installation of KDE. To indicate
    compatibility, there is an attribute "kateversion" in the language
    element of the highlighting files. However, those values have become a
    mess over time.
    
    This patch is a radical clean-up of the kateversion values, setting each
    of them to the lowest possible value that makes sure that compatibility
    is only indicated if the update validates with the shipped definition
    file (language.dtd).

    Support QML multi-line strings.
    
    To do so, we have to copy the slightly adapted String context
    from JavaScript.xml. Furthermore, we must not leak into the JavaScript
    context when we hit a {, rather we copy that as well, otherwise the
    JavaScript string would be detected.
    
    Potentially, we have to think about removing the JavaScript include
    alltogether and duplicating the stuff in the QML highlighter to really
    support the JavaScript subset of QML properly.

    sync hl files with 4.14 branch, some changes seem to have been lost in frameworks :/
    For syntax highlighting, allow .js-files to start with a shebang
    
    When writing node.js scripts it is common to include a shebang at the
    top, like `#!/usr/bin/env node`, and save it in a .js-file. However,
    the syntax highlighter for JavaScript does not understand the shebang,
    and tries to highlight it as JavaScript.
    
    It is understood as two literal regular expressions (/usr/bin and /env
    node), the last of which is not closed, meaning that the rest of the
    file is attempted understood as part of the last regular expression.
    
    This defeats syntax highlighting for .js-files that start with a
    shebang.
    
    This patch allows .js files to start with a shebang.

    Clean up all kateversion numbers according to XML validation
    
    Since KDE 3.0, it is possible to update Kate highlighting files on a per
    user basis using a download dialog in the configuration menu, without
    the need to update the whole installation of KDE. To indicate
    compatibility, there is an attribute "kateversion" in the language
    element of the highlighting files. However, those values have become a
    mess over time.
    
    This patch is a radical clean-up of the kateversion values, setting each
    of them to the lowest possible value that makes sure that compatibility
    is only indicated if the update validates with the shipped definition
    file (language.dtd).

    sync hl files with 4.14 branch, some changes seem to have been lost in frameworks :/
    For syntax highlighting, allow .js-files to start with a shebang
    
    When writing node.js scripts it is common to include a shebang at the
    top, like `#!/usr/bin/env node`, and save it in a .js-file. However,
    the syntax highlighter for JavaScript does not understand the shebang,
    and tries to highlight it as JavaScript.
    
    It is understood as two literal regular expressions (/usr/bin and /env
    node), the last of which is not closed, meaning that the rest of the
    file is attempted understood as part of the last regular expression.
    
    This defeats syntax highlighting for .js-files that start with a
    shebang.
    
    This patch allows .js files to start with a shebang.

    As Varnish 4.x introduces various syntax changes compared to Varnish 3.x, I wrote additional, separate syntax highlighting files for Varnish 4 (varnish4.xml,  varnishtest4.xml).
    I  have also slightly improved the former syntax files (mainly varnishtest.xml) and introduced syntax files for *.vcc files (varnishcc.xml, varnishcc4.xml).

    user basis using a download dialog in the configuration menu, without
    the need to update the whole installation of KDE. To indicate
    compatibility, there is an attribute "kateversion" in the language
    element of the highlighting files. However, those values have become a
    mess over time.
    
    This patch is a radical clean-up of the kateversion values, setting each
    of them to the lowest possible value that makes sure that compatibility
    is only indicated if the update validates with the shipped definition
    file (language.dtd).

    sync hl files with 4.14 branch, some changes seem to have been lost in frameworks :/
    For syntax highlighting, allow .js-files to start with a shebang
    
    When writing node.js scripts it is common to include a shebang at the
    top, like `#!/usr/bin/env node`, and save it in a .js-file. However,
    the syntax highlighter for JavaScript does not understand the shebang,
    and tries to highlight it as JavaScript.
    
    It is understood as two literal regular expressions (/usr/bin and /env
    node), the last of which is not closed, meaning that the rest of the
    file is attempted understood as part of the last regular expression.
    
    This defeats syntax highlighting for .js-files that start with a
    shebang.
    
    This patch allows .js files to start with a shebang.

    syntax highlighting (d-g): use default styles instead of hard-coded colors
    Clean up all kateversion numbers according to XML validation
    
    Since KDE 3.0, it is possible to update Kate highlighting files on a per
    user basis using a download dialog in the configuration menu, without
    the need to update the whole installation of KDE. To indicate
    compatibility, there is an attribute "kateversion" in the language
    element of the highlighting files. However, those values have become a
    mess over time.
    
    This patch is a radical clean-up of the kateversion values, setting each
    of them to the lowest possible value that makes sure that compatibility
    is only indicated if the update validates with the shipped definition
    file (language.dtd).

    normal mode and vi-mode separation
    
    This changes hides vi-mode behind generic input mode interface, which
    means that internals of ktexteditor no longer depends on vi-mode. There
    are no "if"s and only single one #ifdef. And yes there is
    a BUILDE_VIMODE cmake option now, which enables building ktexteditor
    without the vi-mode.
    
    ==  Why ==
    
    Reason for doing this is the reduction of coupling and removal of those
    "if(viInputMode())" cases.
    
    == How it does ==
    
    There is a new directory "inputmode", where the interfaces are. The
    KateAbstractInputModeFactory is ment to by initialized in KateGlobal.
    The view can then use it and ask it for KateAbstractInputMode instance,
    which it can then use in special places like "findNext" or
    "handleKeyPress", etc. The KateViInputModeFactory now hides KateViGlobal
    and KateViInputMode hides the KateViInputModeManager from the rest of
    the system.
    
    The interface of KateAbstractInputMode is currently in very bad shape,
    but that can be cleaned up easily. Lots of the places are oneliners,
    either changing because there is no KateView::getViModeManager anymore
    or because there are now multiple input modes (and yes, it means that
    adding EmacsInputMode after this would not be that much of a nightmare).
    
    == Notes ==
    
    As for the:
    * relative line numbers - plan is to let IconBar call the InputMode for
      rendering that specific part
    * vi-mode specific config options - they are left alone and can be
      refactored afterwards into KateViInputModeFactory
    * input mode specific actions - I would like to see them in Factories
      only, but that might not play well with the shortcut config UI. For
      now I think it's not important.

    This also fixes a crash that happenned in the destructor of the KateViInputMode
    class. The thing here is that the parent of the command bar is the current
    view. Therefore, when the view gets deleted, the command bar will be deleted
    too. However, when the view gets deleted, the destructor of the KateViInputMode
    will be called by the KateViewInternal class. Since the command bar instance
    has already been freed, there's no need to call delete in the destructor
    of the KateViInputMode class.

    normal mode and vi-mode separation
    
    This changes hides vi-mode behind generic input mode interface, which
    means that internals of ktexteditor no longer depends on vi-mode. There
    are no "if"s and only single one #ifdef. And yes there is
    a BUILDE_VIMODE cmake option now, which enables building ktexteditor
    without the vi-mode.
    
    ==  Why ==
    
    Reason for doing this is the reduction of coupling and removal of those
    "if(viInputMode())" cases.
    
    == How it does ==
    
    There is a new directory "inputmode", where the interfaces are. The
    KateAbstractInputModeFactory is ment to by initialized in KateGlobal.
    The view can then use it and ask it for KateAbstractInputMode instance,
    which it can then use in special places like "findNext" or
    "handleKeyPress", etc. The KateViInputModeFactory now hides KateViGlobal
    and KateViInputMode hides the KateViInputModeManager from the rest of
    the system.
    
    The interface of KateAbstractInputMode is currently in very bad shape,
    but that can be cleaned up easily. Lots of the places are oneliners,
    either changing because there is no KateView::getViModeManager anymore
    or because there are now multiple input modes (and yes, it means that
    adding EmacsInputMode after this would not be that much of a nightmare).
    
    == Notes ==
    
    As for the:
    * relative line numbers - plan is to let IconBar call the InputMode for
      rendering that specific part
    * vi-mode specific config options - they are left alone and can be
      refactored afterwards into KateViInputModeFactory
    * input mode specific actions - I would like to see them in Factories

    BUG: 336332
    normal mode and vi-mode separation
    
    This changes hides vi-mode behind generic input mode interface, which
    means that internals of ktexteditor no longer depends on vi-mode. There
    are no "if"s and only single one #ifdef. And yes there is
    a BUILDE_VIMODE cmake option now, which enables building ktexteditor
    without the vi-mode.
    
    ==  Why ==
    
    Reason for doing this is the reduction of coupling and removal of those
    "if(viInputMode())" cases.
    
    == How it does ==
    
    There is a new directory "inputmode", where the interfaces are. The
    KateAbstractInputModeFactory is ment to by initialized in KateGlobal.
    The view can then use it and ask it for KateAbstractInputMode instance,
    which it can then use in special places like "findNext" or
    "handleKeyPress", etc. The KateViInputModeFactory now hides KateViGlobal
    and KateViInputMode hides the KateViInputModeManager from the rest of
    the system.
    
    The interface of KateAbstractInputMode is currently in very bad shape,
    but that can be cleaned up easily. Lots of the places are oneliners,
    either changing because there is no KateView::getViModeManager anymore
    or because there are now multiple input modes (and yes, it means that
    adding EmacsInputMode after this would not be that much of a nightmare).
    
    == Notes ==
    
    As for the:
    * relative line numbers - plan is to let IconBar call the InputMode for
      rendering that specific part
    * vi-mode specific config options - they are left alone and can be
      refactored afterwards into KateViInputModeFactory
    * input mode specific actions - I would like to see them in Factories
      only, but that might not play well with the shortcut config UI. For
      now I think it's not important.

    if calling members for nullptr's (even if non-virtual) is really undefined (and clang will be stupid enough to optimize such check away, which will break the world), we just handle the issue by having some dummy interface object around for:
    
        ::application() of Editor
        ::activeMainWindow() of Application
        ::mainWindow() of View

    Port of ec9a0f7507dbd43
    normal mode and vi-mode separation
    
    This changes hides vi-mode behind generic input mode interface, which
    means that internals of ktexteditor no longer depends on vi-mode. There
    are no "if"s and only single one #ifdef. And yes there is
    a BUILDE_VIMODE cmake option now, which enables building ktexteditor
    without the vi-mode.
    
    ==  Why ==
    
    Reason for doing this is the reduction of coupling and removal of those
    "if(viInputMode())" cases.
    
    == How it does ==
    
    There is a new directory "inputmode", where the interfaces are. The
    KateAbstractInputModeFactory is ment to by initialized in KateGlobal.
    The view can then use it and ask it for KateAbstractInputMode instance,
    which it can then use in special places like "findNext" or
    "handleKeyPress", etc. The KateViInputModeFactory now hides KateViGlobal
    and KateViInputMode hides the KateViInputModeManager from the rest of
    the system.
    
    The interface of KateAbstractInputMode is currently in very bad shape,
    but that can be cleaned up easily. Lots of the places are oneliners,
    either changing because there is no KateView::getViModeManager anymore
    or because there are now multiple input modes (and yes, it means that
    adding EmacsInputMode after this would not be that much of a nightmare).
    
    == Notes ==
    
    As for the:
    * relative line numbers - plan is to let IconBar call the InputMode for
      rendering that specific part
    * vi-mode specific config options - they are left alone and can be
      refactored afterwards into KateViInputModeFactory
    * input mode specific actions - I would like to see them in Factories
      only, but that might not play well with the shortcut config UI. For
      now I think it's not important.

    if calling members for nullptr's (even if non-virtual) is really undefined (and clang will be stupid enough to optimize such check away, which will break the world), we just handle the issue by having some dummy interface object around for:
    
        ::application() of Editor

    The highlighting definition for the highlighting currently in use gets opened when entering the command 'edit-highlighting', and the complete set of highlighting definition gets reloaded on entering 'reload-highlighting' (takes a second or two on my machine).
    
    I thought about a simple caching mechanism based on the mtime of the highlighting definitions, too, but it seems they only get loaded in KateSyntaxDocument::setIdentifier where there is no access to the respective KateHighlighting instance. Caching would require some kind of rewriting that code, then. If you think it’s worth it I could give it a try.

    including the fixup commit 9e05c5dff85c52792f1153566afc94e2413ad128.
    
    This code is used like that for years in KDevelop and works quite
    nicely for most cases.
    
    Note that for darker color schemes, this most often results in
    a bit less-intense colors which is not a big problem as colors stand
    out much more against a dark background. And its better than before,
    where you'd end up with hard-coded colors for a bright background
    scheme...

    add word count statistics in statusbar
    
    This option is disabled by default, because it adds some nontrivial CPU and
    memory overhead, though the implementation tries to keep it as minimal
    as possible.
    
    Whenewer the change in document is triggered, the timer is fired to wait
    for 500ms of inactivity. The trigger is reseted every time the change
    happens so as long as she keeps changing the document every 500ms
    or so, the counting wont stall the editor and her experience.
    
    Longer reculculations are done in batches of size 100 with the help of
    500ms trigger. Which means 10000 lines long document will take 20s to
    compute. Subsequent counting of changes will be much faster because of
    the internal computation cache.
    
    Interface changes includes adding signal KTextEditor::DocumentPrivate::loaded
    to monitor document reload.

    Port of ec9a0f7507dbd43
    normal mode and vi-mode separation
    
    This changes hides vi-mode behind generic input mode interface, which
    means that internals of ktexteditor no longer depends on vi-mode. There
    are no "if"s and only single one #ifdef. And yes there is
    a BUILDE_VIMODE cmake option now, which enables building ktexteditor
    without the vi-mode.
    
    ==  Why ==
    
    Reason for doing this is the reduction of coupling and removal of those
    "if(viInputMode())" cases.
    
    == How it does ==
    
    There is a new directory "inputmode", where the interfaces are. The
    KateAbstractInputModeFactory is ment to by initialized in KateGlobal.
    The view can then use it and ask it for KateAbstractInputMode instance,
    which it can then use in special places like "findNext" or
    "handleKeyPress", etc. The KateViInputModeFactory now hides KateViGlobal
    and KateViInputMode hides the KateViInputModeManager from the rest of
    the system.
    
    The interface of KateAbstractInputMode is currently in very bad shape,
    but that can be cleaned up easily. Lots of the places are oneliners,
    either changing because there is no KateView::getViModeManager anymore
    or because there are now multiple input modes (and yes, it means that
    adding EmacsInputMode after this would not be that much of a nightmare).
    
    == Notes ==
    
    As for the:
    * relative line numbers - plan is to let IconBar call the InputMode for
      rendering that specific part
    * vi-mode specific config options - they are left alone and can be
      refactored afterwards into KateViInputModeFactory
    * input mode specific actions - I would like to see them in Factories
      only, but that might not play well with the shortcut config UI. For
      now I think it's not important.

    Cleanup coe: QMetaObject::invokeMethod is nullptr safe.
    change the way the interfaces are null safe
    if calling members for nullptr's (even if non-virtual) is really undefined (and clang will be stupid enough to optimize such check away, which will break the world), we just handle the issue by having some dummy interface object around for:
    
        ::application() of Editor

    Note that for darker color schemes, this most often results in
    a bit less-intense colors which is not a big problem as colors stand
    out much more against a dark background. And its better than before,
    where you'd end up with hard-coded colors for a bright background
    scheme...
    
    Bright color schemes are not affected, as long as they fulfill the
    conditition of having a lower luma for the background color compared
    to the foreground color.
    Refactor default-color generation into a central place.
    
    This is a forward-port of commit c2dc123f624deff0098bdb74cf9db4542
    in the KDE4 kate repository.
    
    Instead of copy'n'pasting the generation of default colors, we put
    that into a central place and generate the colors there.
    
    Building on top of this patch, I plan to add some auto-tinting
    code as I use in KDevelop for the currently hardcoded colors
    (see Qt::yellow & friends).

    Introduce KTextDocument::searchText(...) method.
    
    Introduce a searchText-method that allows searching for a text pattern
    in a given range, supporting both plaintext and regex searches.
    This essentially gives access to the searchText method that was
    available via the SearchInterface before KF5.

    CHANGELOG: add KTextEditor::Document::searchText()
    Remove global initializations.
    
    Only POD should be initialized globally. Everything else would need
    their ctors run on startup, before everything else. This is bad
    for performance, see e.g.:
    
    http://neugierig.org/software/chromium/notes/2011/08/static-initializers.html
    
    Also note that this is a coding guideline in Qt itself for the same
    reasons. Furthermore, most issues where in places that are only
    used by a fraction of our users, yet all of them "paid" for them
    during startup.

    Temporarily fix automatic spelling + Fix (signal/)slot signature.
    
    respellCheckBlock() signal in KF5 has other parameters than in KDE4
    times. Since onTheFlySpellCheck never was used in KF5 this was not
    found.
    
    Temporarily comment out m_speller.restore() until a better solution
    is done (needs changes in Sonnet) and read the checkerEnabledByDefault
    setting from the global Sonnet configuration.
    add word count statistics in statusbar
    
    This option is disabled by default, because it adds some nontrivial CPU and
    memory overhead, though the implementation tries to keep it as minimal
    as possible.
    
    Whenewer the change in document is triggered, the timer is fired to wait
    for 500ms of inactivity. The trigger is reseted every time the change
    happens so as long as she keeps changing the document every 500ms
    or so, the counting wont stall the editor and her experience.
    
    Longer reculculations are done in batches of size 100 with the help of
    500ms trigger. Which means 10000 lines long document will take 20s to
    compute. Subsequent counting of changes will be much faster because of
    the internal computation cache.
    
    Interface changes includes adding signal KTextEditor::DocumentPrivate::loaded
    to monitor document reload.

    normal mode and vi-mode separation
    
    This changes hides vi-mode behind generic input mode interface, which
    means that internals of ktexteditor no longer depends on vi-mode. There
    are no "if"s and only single one #ifdef. And yes there is
    a BUILDE_VIMODE cmake option now, which enables building ktexteditor
    without the vi-mode.
    
    ==  Why ==
    
    Reason for doing this is the reduction of coupling and removal of those
    "if(viInputMode())" cases.
    
    == How it does ==
    
    There is a new directory "inputmode", where the interfaces are. The
    KateAbstractInputModeFactory is ment to by initialized in KateGlobal.
    The view can then use it and ask it for KateAbstractInputMode instance,
    which it can then use in special places like "findNext" or
    "handleKeyPress", etc. The KateViInputModeFactory now hides KateViGlobal
    and KateViInputMode hides the KateViInputModeManager from the rest of
    the system.
    
    The interface of KateAbstractInputMode is currently in very bad shape,
    but that can be cleaned up easily. Lots of the places are oneliners,
    either changing because there is no KateView::getViModeManager anymore
    or because there are now multiple input modes (and yes, it means that
    adding EmacsInputMode after this would not be that much of a nightmare).
    
    == Notes ==
    
    As for the:
    * relative line numbers - plan is to let IconBar call the InputMode for
      rendering that specific part
    * vi-mode specific config options - they are left alone and can be
      refactored afterwards into KateViInputModeFactory
    * input mode specific actions - I would like to see them in Factories
      only, but that might not play well with the shortcut config UI. For
      now I think it's not important.

    port setShortcut => setDefaultShortcut
    normal mode and vi-mode separation
    
    This changes hides vi-mode behind generic input mode interface, which
    means that internals of ktexteditor no longer depends on vi-mode. There
    are no "if"s and only single one #ifdef. And yes there is
    a BUILDE_VIMODE cmake option now, which enables building ktexteditor
    without the vi-mode.
    
    ==  Why ==
    
    Reason for doing this is the reduction of coupling and removal of those
    "if(viInputMode())" cases.
    
    == How it does ==
    
    There is a new directory "inputmode", where the interfaces are. The
    KateAbstractInputModeFactory is ment to by initialized in KateGlobal.
    The view can then use it and ask it for KateAbstractInputMode instance,
    which it can then use in special places like "findNext" or
    "handleKeyPress", etc. The KateViInputModeFactory now hides KateViGlobal
    and KateViInputMode hides the KateViInputModeManager from the rest of
    the system.
    
    The interface of KateAbstractInputMode is currently in very bad shape,
    but that can be cleaned up easily. Lots of the places are oneliners,
    either changing because there is no KateView::getViModeManager anymore
    or because there are now multiple input modes (and yes, it means that
    adding EmacsInputMode after this would not be that much of a nightmare).
    
    == Notes ==
    
    As for the:
    * relative line numbers - plan is to let IconBar call the InputMode for
      rendering that specific part
    * vi-mode specific config options - they are left alone and can be
      refactored afterwards into KateViInputModeFactory
    * input mode specific actions - I would like to see them in Factories
      only, but that might not play well with the shortcut config UI. For
      now I think it's not important.

    don't crash if coordinates of a cursor behind the document's end are requested
    
    Forwardport by Sven Brauch:
    
    This caused various crashes in the bracket matching animation and the
    collaborative plugin's popup animations if they affected text near the
    end of the document which was then removed. The fix applied by this
    commit is rather broad, but should prevent all similar crashes in the
    future by making the API more robust.

    Refactor default-color generation into a central place.
    
    This is a forward-port of commit c2dc123f624deff0098bdb74cf9db4542
    in the KDE4 kate repository.
    
    Instead of copy'n'pasting the generation of default colors, we put
    that into a central place and generate the colors there.
    
    Building on top of this patch, I plan to add some auto-tinting
    code as I use in KDevelop for the currently hardcoded colors
    (see Qt::yellow & friends).
    Introduce categories for the default styles
    
    Current categories:
    - Normal Text and Source Code
    - Strings and Characters
    - Comments and Documentation
    - Miscellaneous
    
    The code is not optimal: copied 4 types the for-loop...
    Improvements welcome - it'll work for now, though.
    Increase number of default styles from 14 to 31
    
    This change is incompatible in the following ways:
    - the public HighlightInterfaces enum changes
    - since the enum changed, it is not possible to import old Schemas
    from Kate 3.x
    let automoc do its job
    add same trick for KTextEditor::View, internally store pointer to ViewPrivate implementation to allow to have non-virtual funtions for extensions
    EditorPrivate impl, that way we can avoid lots of virtual functions

    vi-mode: fix relative line numbers
    
    exporting KateIconBorder in KateViewInternal to be able to configure it
    remove (ViewPrivate|KateViewInternal)::setCarretStyle
    
    We currently read it directly in repaint routine.
    Repaints of updated cursor can be triggered trought
    KateViewInternal::paintCursor slot.
    normal mode and vi-mode separation
    
    This changes hides vi-mode behind generic input mode interface, which
    means that internals of ktexteditor no longer depends on vi-mode. There
    are no "if"s and only single one #ifdef. And yes there is
    a BUILDE_VIMODE cmake option now, which enables building ktexteditor
    without the vi-mode.
    
    ==  Why ==
    
    Reason for doing this is the reduction of coupling and removal of those
    "if(viInputMode())" cases.
    
    == How it does ==
    
    There is a new directory "inputmode", where the interfaces are. The
    KateAbstractInputModeFactory is ment to by initialized in KateGlobal.
    The view can then use it and ask it for KateAbstractInputMode instance,
    which it can then use in special places like "findNext" or
    "handleKeyPress", etc. The KateViInputModeFactory now hides KateViGlobal
    and KateViInputMode hides the KateViInputModeManager from the rest of
    the system.
    
    The interface of KateAbstractInputMode is currently in very bad shape,
    but that can be cleaned up easily. Lots of the places are oneliners,
    either changing because there is no KateView::getViModeManager anymore
    or because there are now multiple input modes (and yes, it means that
    adding EmacsInputMode after this would not be that much of a nightmare).
    
    == Notes ==
    
    As for the:
    * relative line numbers - plan is to let IconBar call the InputMode for
      rendering that specific part
    * vi-mode specific config options - they are left alone and can be
      refactored afterwards into KateViInputModeFactory
    * input mode specific actions - I would like to see them in Factories
      only, but that might not play well with the shortcut config UI. For
      now I think it's not important.

    CHANGELOG: add KTextEditor::Document::searchText()

    This option is disabled by default, because it adds some nontrivial CPU and
    memory overhead, though the implementation tries to keep it as minimal
    as possible.
    
    Whenewer the change in document is triggered, the timer is fired to wait
    for 500ms of inactivity. The trigger is reseted every time the change
    happens so as long as she keeps changing the document every 500ms
    or so, the counting wont stall the editor and her experience.
    
    Longer reculculations are done in batches of size 100 with the help of
    500ms trigger. Which means 10000 lines long document will take 20s to
    compute. Subsequent counting of changes will be much faster because of
    the internal computation cache.

    BUG: 339338
    revive the template interface
    - Use QGridLayout for setting up View layout
    - Added QSpacerItems in order to properly implement frame around edition area.
    - properly account for whether style requires frame around contents only, or around contents + scrollbars
    - Call style primitive in order to render a frame around the said area, with proper mouse-over and focus set.
    - Adjust scrollbar background based on whether frame must be drawn around contents only, or scrollbars+contents
    - Force update of widget and scrollbars on focusIn and focusOut events

    remove (ViewPrivate|KateViewInternal)::setCarretStyle
    
    We currently read it directly in repaint routine.
    Repaints of updated cursor can be triggered trought
    KateViewInternal::paintCursor slot.
    normal mode and vi-mode separation
    
    This changes hides vi-mode behind generic input mode interface, which
    means that internals of ktexteditor no longer depends on vi-mode. There
    are no "if"s and only single one #ifdef. And yes there is
    a BUILDE_VIMODE cmake option now, which enables building ktexteditor
    without the vi-mode.
    
    ==  Why ==
    
    Reason for doing this is the reduction of coupling and removal of those
    "if(viInputMode())" cases.
    
    == How it does ==
    
    There is a new directory "inputmode", where the interfaces are. The
    KateAbstractInputModeFactory is ment to by initialized in KateGlobal.
    The view can then use it and ask it for KateAbstractInputMode instance,
    which it can then use in special places like "findNext" or
    "handleKeyPress", etc. The KateViInputModeFactory now hides KateViGlobal
    and KateViInputMode hides the KateViInputModeManager from the rest of
    the system.
    
    The interface of KateAbstractInputMode is currently in very bad shape,
    but that can be cleaned up easily. Lots of the places are oneliners,
    either changing because there is no KateView::getViModeManager anymore
    or because there are now multiple input modes (and yes, it means that
    adding EmacsInputMode after this would not be that much of a nightmare).
    
    == Notes ==
    
    As for the:
    * relative line numbers - plan is to let IconBar call the InputMode for
      rendering that specific part
    * vi-mode specific config options - they are left alone and can be
      refactored afterwards into KateViInputModeFactory
    * input mode specific actions - I would like to see them in Factories
      only, but that might not play well with the shortcut config UI. For
      now I think it's not important.

    * It now feel "native" in the canvas for both Breeze and Fusion
      styles. Oxygen has some hardcoded extra borders, this is a
      known limitation of this patch.
    * Improve support for darker themes. The previous implementation
      failed to properly display the visible area
    * Partially degrade the visible section view when the handle is
      at its minimum height. This could be improved later on.

    vi-mode: fix relative line numbers
    
    exporting KateIconBorder in KateViewInternal to be able to configure it
    normal mode and vi-mode separation
    
    This changes hides vi-mode behind generic input mode interface, which
    means that internals of ktexteditor no longer depends on vi-mode. There
    are no "if"s and only single one #ifdef. And yes there is
    a BUILDE_VIMODE cmake option now, which enables building ktexteditor
    without the vi-mode.
    
    ==  Why ==
    
    Reason for doing this is the reduction of coupling and removal of those
    "if(viInputMode())" cases.
    
    == How it does ==
    
    There is a new directory "inputmode", where the interfaces are. The
    KateAbstractInputModeFactory is ment to by initialized in KateGlobal.
    The view can then use it and ask it for KateAbstractInputMode instance,
    which it can then use in special places like "findNext" or
    "handleKeyPress", etc. The KateViInputModeFactory now hides KateViGlobal
    and KateViInputMode hides the KateViInputModeManager from the rest of
    the system.
    
    The interface of KateAbstractInputMode is currently in very bad shape,
    but that can be cleaned up easily. Lots of the places are oneliners,
    either changing because there is no KateView::getViModeManager anymore
    or because there are now multiple input modes (and yes, it means that
    adding EmacsInputMode after this would not be that much of a nightmare).
    
    == Notes ==
    
    As for the:
    * relative line numbers - plan is to let IconBar call the InputMode for
      rendering that specific part
    * vi-mode specific config options - they are left alone and can be
      refactored afterwards into KateViInputModeFactory
    * input mode specific actions - I would like to see them in Factories
      only, but that might not play well with the shortcut config UI. For
      now I think it's not important.

    fix HiDPI issues
    add word count statistics in statusbar
    
    This option is disabled by default, because it adds some nontrivial CPU and
    memory overhead, though the implementation tries to keep it as minimal
    as possible.
    
    Whenewer the change in document is triggered, the timer is fired to wait
    for 500ms of inactivity. The trigger is reseted every time the change
    happens so as long as she keeps changing the document every 500ms
    or so, the counting wont stall the editor and her experience.
    
    Longer reculculations are done in batches of size 100 with the help of
    500ms trigger. Which means 10000 lines long document will take 20s to
    compute. Subsequent counting of changes will be much faster because of
    the internal computation cache.
    
    Interface changes includes adding signal KTextEditor::DocumentPrivate::loaded
    to monitor document reload.

    Fix startup crash on Windows/MSVC.
    
    MSVC uses a different representation for pointers to member functions
    depending on the complexity of the class inheritance, and uses a general
    representation if it can't determine the inheritance tree, such as if it
    only sees a forward declaration of the class. This means pointers to
    members get a different size depending on whether the class is forward-
    declared or fully defined. Which violates the C++ standard, by the way :)
    
    ViMode::Command (which contains a pointer to member function) got a
    different size in translation units that included normalvimode.h than in
    those that didn't, causing crashes. Solved by including normalvimode.h
    from command.h so that the class is always fully defined.

    Introduce KTextDocument::searchText(...) method.
    
    Introduce a searchText-method that allows searching for a text pattern
    in a given range, supporting both plaintext and regex searches.
    This essentially gives access to the searchText method that was
    available via the SearchInterface before KF5.

    Remove global initializations.
    
    Only POD should be initialized globally. Everything else would need
    their ctors run on startup, before everything else. This is bad
    for performance, see e.g.:
    
    http://neugierig.org/software/chromium/notes/2011/08/static-initializers.html
    
    Also note that this is a coding guideline in Qt itself for the same
    reasons. Furthermore, most issues where in places that are only
    used by a fraction of our users, yet all of them "paid" for them
    during startup.
    
    The code places where all found by the python script shown here:
    
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28101243/how-to-find-global-static-initializations/28146199?noredirect=1#28146199
    
    It was also used to verify that no global ctors remain, besides one
    QRC initialization.

    normal mode and vi-mode separation
    
    This changes hides vi-mode behind generic input mode interface, which
    means that internals of ktexteditor no longer depends on vi-mode. There
    are no "if"s and only single one #ifdef. And yes there is
    a BUILDE_VIMODE cmake option now, which enables building ktexteditor
    without the vi-mode.
    
    ==  Why ==
    
    Reason for doing this is the reduction of coupling and removal of those
    "if(viInputMode())" cases.
    
    == How it does ==
    
    There is a new directory "inputmode", where the interfaces are. The
    KateAbstractInputModeFactory is ment to by initialized in KateGlobal.
    The view can then use it and ask it for KateAbstractInputMode instance,
    which it can then use in special places like "findNext" or
    "handleKeyPress", etc. The KateViInputModeFactory now hides KateViGlobal
    and KateViInputMode hides the KateViInputModeManager from the rest of
    the system.
    
    The interface of KateAbstractInputMode is currently in very bad shape,
    but that can be cleaned up easily. Lots of the places are oneliners,
    either changing because there is no KateView::getViModeManager anymore
    or because there are now multiple input modes (and yes, it means that
    adding EmacsInputMode after this would not be that much of a nightmare).
    
    == Notes ==
    
    As for the:
    * relative line numbers - plan is to let IconBar call the InputMode for
      rendering that specific part
    * vi-mode specific config options - they are left alone and can be
      refactored afterwards into KateViInputModeFactory
    * input mode specific actions - I would like to see them in Factories
      only, but that might not play well with the shortcut config UI. For
      now I think it's not important.

    Fix startup crash on Windows/MSVC.
    
    MSVC uses a different representation for pointers to member functions
    depending on the complexity of the class inheritance, and uses a general
    representation if it can't determine the inheritance tree, such as if it
    only sees a forward declaration of the class. This means pointers to
    members get a different size depending on whether the class is forward-
    declared or fully defined. Which violates the C++ standard, by the way :)
    
    ViMode::Command (which contains a pointer to member function) got a
    different size in translation units that included normalvimode.h than in
    those that didn't, causing crashes. Solved by including normalvimode.h
    from command.h so that the class is always fully defined.

    This also fixes a crash that happenned in the destructor of the KateViInputMode
    class. The thing here is that the parent of the command bar is the current
    view. Therefore, when the view gets deleted, the command bar will be deleted
    too. However, when the view gets deleted, the destructor of the KateViInputMode
    will be called by the KateViewInternal class. Since the command bar instance
    has already been freed, there's no need to call delete in the destructor
    of the KateViInputMode class.

    vi-mode: small cleanup
    normal mode and vi-mode separation
    
    This changes hides vi-mode behind generic input mode interface, which
    means that internals of ktexteditor no longer depends on vi-mode. There
    are no "if"s and only single one #ifdef. And yes there is
    a BUILDE_VIMODE cmake option now, which enables building ktexteditor
    without the vi-mode.
    
    ==  Why ==
    
    Reason for doing this is the reduction of coupling and removal of those
    "if(viInputMode())" cases.
    
    == How it does ==
    
    There is a new directory "inputmode", where the interfaces are. The
    KateAbstractInputModeFactory is ment to by initialized in KateGlobal.
    The view can then use it and ask it for KateAbstractInputMode instance,
    which it can then use in special places like "findNext" or
    "handleKeyPress", etc. The KateViInputModeFactory now hides KateViGlobal
    and KateViInputMode hides the KateViInputModeManager from the rest of
    the system.
    
    The interface of KateAbstractInputMode is currently in very bad shape,
    but that can be cleaned up easily. Lots of the places are oneliners,
    either changing because there is no KateView::getViModeManager anymore
    or because there are now multiple input modes (and yes, it means that
    adding EmacsInputMode after this would not be that much of a nightmare).
    
    == Notes ==
    
    As for the:
    * relative line numbers - plan is to let IconBar call the InputMode for
      rendering that specific part
    * vi-mode specific config options - they are left alone and can be
      refactored afterwards into KateViInputModeFactory

    normal mode and vi-mode separation
    
    This changes hides vi-mode behind generic input mode interface, which
    means that internals of ktexteditor no longer depends on vi-mode. There
    are no "if"s and only single one #ifdef. And yes there is
    a BUILDE_VIMODE cmake option now, which enables building ktexteditor
    without the vi-mode.
    
    ==  Why ==
    
    Reason for doing this is the reduction of coupling and removal of those
    "if(viInputMode())" cases.
    
    == How it does ==
    
    There is a new directory "inputmode", where the interfaces are. The
    KateAbstractInputModeFactory is ment to by initialized in KateGlobal.
    The view can then use it and ask it for KateAbstractInputMode instance,
    which it can then use in special places like "findNext" or
    "handleKeyPress", etc. The KateViInputModeFactory now hides KateViGlobal
    and KateViInputMode hides the KateViInputModeManager from the rest of
    the system.
    
    The interface of KateAbstractInputMode is currently in very bad shape,
    but that can be cleaned up easily. Lots of the places are oneliners,
    either changing because there is no KateView::getViModeManager anymore
    or because there are now multiple input modes (and yes, it means that
    adding EmacsInputMode after this would not be that much of a nightmare).
    
    == Notes ==
    
    As for the:
    * relative line numbers - plan is to let IconBar call the InputMode for
      rendering that specific part
    * vi-mode specific config options - they are left alone and can be
      refactored afterwards into KateViInputModeFactory
    * input mode specific actions - I would like to see them in Factories
      only, but that might not play well with the shortcut config UI. For
      now I think it's not important.

    vi-mode: set caret style in ViInputMode
    normal mode and vi-mode separation
    
    This changes hides vi-mode behind generic input mode interface, which
    means that internals of ktexteditor no longer depends on vi-mode. There
    are no "if"s and only single one #ifdef. And yes there is
    a BUILDE_VIMODE cmake option now, which enables building ktexteditor
    without the vi-mode.
    
    ==  Why ==
    
    Reason for doing this is the reduction of coupling and removal of those
    "if(viInputMode())" cases.
    
    == How it does ==
    
    There is a new directory "inputmode", where the interfaces are. The
    KateAbstractInputModeFactory is ment to by initialized in KateGlobal.
    The view can then use it and ask it for KateAbstractInputMode instance,
    which it can then use in special places like "findNext" or
    "handleKeyPress", etc. The KateViInputModeFactory now hides KateViGlobal
    and KateViInputMode hides the KateViInputModeManager from the rest of
    the system.
    
    The interface of KateAbstractInputMode is currently in very bad shape,
    but that can be cleaned up easily. Lots of the places are oneliners,
    either changing because there is no KateView::getViModeManager anymore
    or because there are now multiple input modes (and yes, it means that
    adding EmacsInputMode after this would not be that much of a nightmare).
    
    == Notes ==
    
    As for the:
    * relative line numbers - plan is to let IconBar call the InputMode for
      rendering that specific part
    * vi-mode specific config options - they are left alone and can be
      refactored afterwards into KateViInputModeFactory
    * input mode specific actions - I would like to see them in Factories
      only, but that might not play well with the shortcut config UI. For
      now I think it's not important.

    This option is disabled by default, because it adds some nontrivial CPU and

    as possible.
    
    Whenewer the change in document is triggered, the timer is fired to wait
    for 500ms of inactivity. The trigger is reseted every time the change
    happens so as long as she keeps changing the document every 500ms
    or so, the counting wont stall the editor and her experience.
    
    Longer reculculations are done in batches of size 100 with the help of
    500ms trigger. Which means 10000 lines long document will take 20s to
    compute. Subsequent counting of changes will be much faster because of
    the internal computation cache.

    Introduce a searchText-method that allows searching for a text pattern

    CHANGELOG: add KTextEditor::Document::searchText()
    Remove virtual we have Q_DECL_OVERRIDE
    add word count statistics in statusbar
    
    This option is disabled by default, because it adds some nontrivial CPU and
    memory overhead, though the implementation tries to keep it as minimal
    as possible.
    
    Whenewer the change in document is triggered, the timer is fired to wait
    for 500ms of inactivity. The trigger is reseted every time the change
    happens so as long as she keeps changing the document every 500ms
    or so, the counting wont stall the editor and her experience.
    
    Longer reculculations are done in batches of size 100 with the help of
    500ms trigger. Which means 10000 lines long document will take 20s to
    compute. Subsequent counting of changes will be much faster because of
    the internal computation cache.
    
    Interface changes includes adding signal KTextEditor::DocumentPrivate::loaded
    to monitor document reload.

    for performance, see e.g.:
    
    http://neugierig.org/software/chromium/notes/2011/08/static-initializers.html
    
    Also note that this is a coding guideline in Qt itself for the same
    reasons. Furthermore, most issues where in places that are only
    used by a fraction of our users, yet all of them "paid" for them
    during startup.

    Fix bug #340212: incorrect soft-tabs alignment after beginning-of-line
    
    Fix for incorrect soft-tabs alignment after beginning-of-line, by taking the current cursor position into account when expanding tabs to spaces.
    
    This also now uses the indentation width rather than the tab width, as I see "Tab Width" as being the actual width of the \t character, and "Indentation width" as being the next alignment position for virtual indentation.  This more closely matches other editors (e.g. vim) which have similar indentation control.

    Fix for UTF-16 surrogate pair backspace/delete behavior.
    
    Kate stores it's text in QStrings, which use UTF-16 internally.
    
    Currently in Kate when you backspace or delete key at the end or start
    of a UTF-16 surrogate pair, only half of the surrogate pair will be
    deleted; leaving a question-mark symbol in the editor.
    
    This can be seen by inserting a U+1D43D (Mathematical Italic Capital J)
    code-point and trying to backspace or delete it.
    
    With this patch backspace and delete should work as expected, though
    there is other weird behavior related to 205447 that are not fixed.
    In particular: block selection can look funky, and characters that
    use multiple code-points (such as combining characters) still
    don't get deleted properly.

    add word count statistics in statusbar
    
    This option is disabled by default, because it adds some nontrivial CPU and
    memory overhead, though the implementation tries to keep it as minimal
    as possible.
    
    Whenewer the change in document is triggered, the timer is fired to wait
    for 500ms of inactivity. The trigger is reseted every time the change
    happens so as long as she keeps changing the document every 500ms
    or so, the counting wont stall the editor and her experience.
    
    Longer reculculations are done in batches of size 100 with the help of
    500ms trigger. Which means 10000 lines long document will take 20s to
    compute. Subsequent counting of changes will be much faster because of
    the internal computation cache.
    
    Interface changes includes adding signal KTextEditor::DocumentPrivate::loaded
    to monitor document reload.

    Implement overwrite mode in block selection mode
    
    Lets just try that out, before it hangs around for ever in the moderation queue ;=)
    
    Currently, when in multi-column block selection mode, overwrite only overwrites in the first line. In all other lines, the text is not overwritten (only inserted).
    With this patch, overwrite mode in block selection multi-line mode overwrites in all selected lines.
    
    As always, tab characters spanning multiple columns are problematic, but this was a problem also before this patch.
    Would be good if someone tries this patch to provide feedback.
    
    @Andrey: Since you initially implemented this feature, did you intentionally omit overwriting all lines because of the tab characters?
    
    @vi input mode: Before this patch, the vi input mode got the overwrite-character of the first line. With this patch, the overwrite-mode gets all removed characters (of all lines). Is this the desired behavior? Feedback welcome.

    Remove global initializations.
    
    Only POD should be initialized globally. Everything else would need
    their ctors run on startup, before everything else. This is bad
    for performance, see e.g.:
    
    http://neugierig.org/software/chromium/notes/2011/08/static-initializers.html
    
    Also note that this is a coding guideline in Qt itself for the same
    reasons. Furthermore, most issues where in places that are only
    used by a fraction of our users, yet all of them "paid" for them
    during startup.
    
    The code places where all found by the python script shown here:

    remove KF6 comment again, was a misunderstanding
    Cleanup CMake code around libgit2 usage and future-proof it.
    
    Use CHECK_FUNCTION_EXISTS to figure out whether there is
    git_threads_init, and blindly use it if its available. According
    to the docs, it's a no-op if libgit2 is not threadsafe.
    
    For future releases of libgit2 though, we'll need to use
    git_libgit2_init and git_libgit2_shutdown instead, which is also
    added with this patch now.
    
    Furthermore we use configure_file instead of manually adding defines
    to all translation units. This approach is much cleaner and explicit.
    Furthermore we'll only have to recompile those TU's that actually use
    the macros, instead of all, when the libgit2 configuration changes.
    Fix bug #340212: incorrect soft-tabs alignment after beginning-of-line
    
    Fix for incorrect soft-tabs alignment after beginning-of-line, by taking the current cursor position into account when expanding tabs to spaces.
    
    This also now uses the indentation width rather than the tab width, as I see "Tab Width" as being the actual width of the \t character, and "Indentation width" as being the next alignment position for virtual indentation.  This more closely matches other editors (e.g. vim) which have similar indentation control.

    Both functions are not exported anyway, so this is a purely
    internal change.
    normal mode and vi-mode separation
    
    This changes hides vi-mode behind generic input mode interface, which
    means that internals of ktexteditor no longer depends on vi-mode. There
    are no "if"s and only single one #ifdef. And yes there is
    a BUILDE_VIMODE cmake option now, which enables building ktexteditor
    without the vi-mode.
    
    ==  Why ==
    
    Reason for doing this is the reduction of coupling and removal of those
    "if(viInputMode())" cases.
    
    == How it does ==
    
    There is a new directory "inputmode", where the interfaces are. The
    KateAbstractInputModeFactory is ment to by initialized in KateGlobal.
    The view can then use it and ask it for KateAbstractInputMode instance,
    which it can then use in special places like "findNext" or
    "handleKeyPress", etc. The KateViInputModeFactory now hides KateViGlobal
    and KateViInputMode hides the KateViInputModeManager from the rest of
    the system.
    
    The interface of KateAbstractInputMode is currently in very bad shape,
    but that can be cleaned up easily. Lots of the places are oneliners,
    either changing because there is no KateView::getViModeManager anymore
    or because there are now multiple input modes (and yes, it means that
    adding EmacsInputMode after this would not be that much of a nightmare).
    
    == Notes ==
    
    As for the:
    * relative line numbers - plan is to let IconBar call the InputMode for
      rendering that specific part
    * vi-mode specific config options - they are left alone and can be
      refactored afterwards into KateViInputModeFactory
    * input mode specific actions - I would like to see them in Factories
      only, but that might not play well with the shortcut config UI. For
      now I think it's not important.

    Fix broken model design, which relied on Qt 4 behavior.
    
    Implementing a tree model on top of a QAbstractTableModel just calls
    for problems. Indeed, in Qt5, things like ::sibling got optimized for
    the flat QTableModel needs, and thus utterly broke the "fancy" tree
    mode used for code completion in KDevelop.

    the problem was the countItems, not sure since how long this was broken, an other problem
    was that we skipped all tests if we have no ksycoca, which is a stupid idea imho
    as this will just hide the problems locally for you (and I think we don't need

    The calculation of the column widths did not take children properly

    first index pointed to a group label...
    
    Also, the width of the group label was taken into account for *all*
    columns, not just the one where it actually gets displayed in :(
    
    In the future, one could also look at implementing column span for the
    label, to prevent the increase of the first column width when the
    labels such as 'Language Keywords' are shown - it could use the full
    width of all columns and not increase the first column width.

    Resize the tree when the completion model got reset.
    
    This fixes a serious layout glitch in KDevelop, where code completion
    can trigger an async model reset, e.g. when we add a delayed group
    to implement a function.
    
    There, showing the completion tree for the first time instantaneously
    filled it without groups from the language keyword and editor word
    models and resized the tree accordingly. Note that no group labels
    exist then. Now, after some time, the KDevelop completion models get
    added and add group labels. Before, the size of the group labels
    was not taken into account at all. Now, we resize the widget properly
    and the layout glitch is gone.
    Stop resize timer when we resize.
    
    This removes on resize operation when the tree is shown for the first time.
    Cleanup code, reuse existing function.

    Fix broken model design, which relied on Qt 4 behavior.
    
    Implementing a tree model on top of a QAbstractTableModel just calls
    for problems. Indeed, in Qt5, things like ::sibling got optimized for
    the flat QTableModel needs, and thus utterly broke the "fancy" tree
    mode used for code completion in KDevelop.
    Use Q_DECL_OVERRIDE where possible

    Remove global initializations.
    
    Only POD should be initialized globally. Everything else would need
    their ctors run on startup, before everything else. This is bad
    for performance, see e.g.:
    
    http://neugierig.org/software/chromium/notes/2011/08/static-initializers.html
    
    Also note that this is a coding guideline in Qt itself for the same
    reasons. Furthermore, most issues where in places that are only
    used by a fraction of our users, yet all of them "paid" for them
    during startup.
    
    The code places where all found by the python script shown here:

    It was also used to verify that no global ctors remain, besides one
    QRC initialization.

    It would be nice to convert some or all of the documentation pages to

    doxygen first.

    Introduce KTextDocument::searchText(...) method.
    
    Introduce a searchText-method that allows searching for a text pattern
    in a given range, supporting both plaintext and regex searches.
    This essentially gives access to the searchText method that was
    available via the SearchInterface before KF5.
