    Use int64_t for milliseconds more often, primarily for TimeUntilNextProcess.
    
    This fixes a variety of MSVC warnings about value truncations when implicitly

    This also moves a number of constants so they're declared right where they're used, which is easier to read and maintain, and makes some of them of integral type rather than using the "enum hack".

    Use int64_t for milliseconds more often, primarily for TimeUntilNextProcess.
    
    This fixes a variety of MSVC warnings about value truncations when implicitly
    storing the 64-bit values we get back from e.g. TimeTicks in 32-bit objects, and
    removes the need for a number of explicit casts.

    Refactor the AudioDevice for iOS and improve the performance and stability
    
    This CL contains major modifications of the audio output parts for WebRTC on iOS:
    - general code cleanup
    - improves thread handling (added thread checks, remove critical section, atomic ops etc.)
    - reduces loopback latency of iPhone 6 from ~90ms to ~60ms ;-)
    - improves selection of audio parameters on iOS
    - reduces complexity by removing complex and redundant delay estimates
    - now instead uses fixed delay estimates if for some reason the SW EAC must be used
    - adds AudioFineBuffer to compensate for differences in native output buffer size and
      the 10ms size used by WebRTC. Same class as is used today on Android and we have unit tests for
      this class (the old code was buggy and we have several issue reports of crashes related to it)
    
    Similar improvements will be done for the recording sid as well in a separate CL.
    I will also add support for 48kHz in an upcoming CL since that will improve Opus performance.

    Convert some more things to size_t.
    
    These changes stem from requests by Andrew on https://codereview.webrtc.org/1228823002/ to eliminate some "return -1"s and change to using asserts plus returning size_ts.  I then also converted the relevant connected bits.
    
    This also cleans up a bunch of style issues, e.g. no spaces around operators.

    Update a ton of audio code to use size_t more correctly and in general reduce

    This is the upshot of a recommendation by henrik.lundin and kwiberg on an original small change ( https://webrtc-codereview.appspot.com/42569004/#ps1 ) to stop using int16_t just because values could fit in it, and is similar in nature to a previous "mass change to use size_t more" ( https://webrtc-codereview.appspot.com/23129004/ ) which also needed to be split up for review but to land all at once, since, like adding "const", such changes tend to cause a lot of transitive effects.

    Fix the chain that propagates the audio frame's rtp and ntp timestamp including:
    * In AudioCodingModuleImpl::PlayoutData10Ms, don't reset the timestamp got from GetAudio.
    * When there're more than one participant, set AudioFrame's RTP timestamp to 0.
    * Copy ntp_time_ms_ in AudioFrame::CopyFrom method.
    * In RemixAndResample, pass src frame's timestamp_ and ntp_time_ms_ to the dst frame.
    * Fix how |elapsed_time_ms| is computed in channel.cc by adding GetPlayoutFrequency.
    
    Tweaks on ntp_time_ms_:
    * Init ntp_time_ms_ to -1 in AudioFrame ctor.
    * When there're more than one participant, set AudioFrame's ntp_time_ms_ to an invalid value. I.e. we don't support ntp_time_ms_ in multiple participants case before the mixing is moved to chrome.
    
    Added elapsed_time_ms to AudioFrame and pass it to chrome, where we don't have the information about the rtp timestmp's sample rate, i.e. can't convert rtp timestamp to ms.

    * When there're more than one participant, set AudioFrame's ntp_time_ms_ to an invalid value. I.e. we don't support ntp_time_ms_ in multiple participants case before the mixing is moved to chrome.
    
    Added elapsed_time_ms to AudioFrame and pass it to chrome, where we don't have the information about the rtp timestmp's sample rate, i.e. can't convert rtp timestamp to ms.

    Merge r4394 from stable to trunk.
    
    r4326 was mistakenly committed to stable, so this is to re-merge back to trunk.
    
    Fixed the AGC and interface problems on the new path.
    
    In order to make the AGC work properly, we need to cache the volume value passed
    by the callback, compare it with the value returned by
    shared->transmit_mixer()->CaptureLevel(). If they are the same, we need to
    return 0 to indicate no volume needs changing, otherwise return the new volume.
    By doing this, we avoid setting the volume all the same, which allows the users
    to change the volume manually.
    
    This patch also fixes some minor issues with the interfaces too: make the int
    channel[] const, and correct the order of the input params in
    channel::Demultiplex.

    Adding support for OpenSL ES output in native WebRTC
    
    BUG=4573,2982,2175,3590
    TEST=modules_unittests --gtest_filter=AudioDevice*, AppRTCDemo and WebRTCDemo
    
    Summary:
    
    - Removes dependency of the 'enable_android_opensl' compiler flag.
      Instead, OpenSL ES is always supported, and will enabled for devices that
      supports low-latency output.
    - WebRTC no longer supports OpenSL ES for the input/recording side.
    - Removes old code and demos using OpenSL ES for audio input.
    - Improves accuracy of total delay estimates (better AEC performance).
    - Reduces roundtrip audio latency; especially when OpenSL can be used.
    
    Performance verified on: Nexus 5, 6, 7 and 9. Samsung Galaxy S4 and S6.
    Android One device.

    Adds C++/JNI/Java unit test for audio device module on Android.
    
    This CL adds support for unittests of the AudioDeviceModule on Android using both Java and C++. The new framework uses ::testing::TesWithParam to support both Java-based audio and OpenSL ES based audio. However, given existing issues in our OpenSL ES implementation, the list of test parameters only contains Java in this first version. Open SL ES will be enabled as soon as the backend has been refactored.
    
    It also:
    
    - Removes the redundant JNIEnv* argument in webrtc::VoiceEngine::SetAndroidObjects().
    - Modifies usage of enable_android_opensl and the WEBRTC_ANDROID_OPENSLES define.
    - Adds kAndroidJavaAudio and kAndroidOpenSLESAudio to AudioLayer enumerator.
    - Fixes some bugs which were discovered when running the tests.

    Adds C++/JNI/Java unit test for audio device module on Android.
    
    This CL adds support for unittests of the AudioDeviceModule on Android using both Java and C++. The new framework uses ::testing::TesWithParam to support both Java-based audio and OpenSL ES based audio. However, given existing issues in our OpenSL ES implementation, the list of test parameters only contains Java in this first version. Open SL ES will be enabled as soon as the backend has been refactored.
    
    It also:
    
    - Removes the redundant JNIEnv* argument in webrtc::VoiceEngine::SetAndroidObjects().
    - Modifies usage of enable_android_opensl and the WEBRTC_ANDROID_OPENSLES define.
    - Adds kAndroidJavaAudio and kAndroidOpenSLESAudio to AudioLayer enumerator.
    - Fixes some bugs which were discovered when running the tests.

    Add RTC_ prefix to (D)CHECKs and related macros.
    
    We must remove dependency on Chromium, i.e. we can't use Chromium's base/logging.h. That means we need to define these macros in WebRTC also when doing Chromium builds. And this causes redefinition.
    
    Alternative solutions:
    * Check if we already have defined e.g. CHECK, and don't define them in that case. This makes us depend on include order in Chromium, which is not acceptable.
    * Don't allow using the macros in WebRTC headers. Error prone since if someone adds it there by mistake it may compile fine, but later break if a header in added or order is changed in Chromium. That will be confusing and hard to enforce.
    * Ensure that headers that are included by an embedder don't include our macros. This would require some heavy refactoring to be maintainable and enforcable.
    * Changes in Chromium for this is obviously not an option.

    Adding support for OpenSL ES output in native WebRTC
    
    BUG=4573,2982,2175,3590
    TEST=modules_unittests --gtest_filter=AudioDevice*, AppRTCDemo and WebRTCDemo
    
    Summary:
    
    - Removes dependency of the 'enable_android_opensl' compiler flag.
      Instead, OpenSL ES is always supported, and will enabled for devices that
      supports low-latency output.
    - WebRTC no longer supports OpenSL ES for the input/recording side.
    - Removes old code and demos using OpenSL ES for audio input.
    - Improves accuracy of total delay estimates (better AEC performance).
    - Reduces roundtrip audio latency; especially when OpenSL can be used.
    
    Performance verified on: Nexus 5, 6, 7 and 9. Samsung Galaxy S4 and S6.
    Android One device.

    Update a ton of audio code to use size_t more correctly and in general reduce
    use of int16_t/uint16_t.
    
    This is the upshot of a recommendation by henrik.lundin and kwiberg on an original small change ( https://webrtc-codereview.appspot.com/42569004/#ps1 ) to stop using int16_t just because values could fit in it, and is similar in nature to a previous "mass change to use size_t more" ( https://webrtc-codereview.appspot.com/23129004/ ) which also needed to be split up for review but to land all at once, since, like adding "const", such changes tend to cause a lot of transitive effects.

    Update a ton of audio code to use size_t more correctly and in general reduce
    use of int16_t/uint16_t.
    
    This is the upshot of a recommendation by henrik.lundin and kwiberg on an original small change ( https://webrtc-codereview.appspot.com/42569004/#ps1 ) to stop using int16_t just because values could fit in it, and is similar in nature to a previous "mass change to use size_t more" ( https://webrtc-codereview.appspot.com/23129004/ ) which also needed to be split up for review but to land all at once, since, like adding "const", such changes tend to cause a lot of transitive effects.

    Reformat existing code.  There should be no functional effects.
    
    This includes changes like:
    * Attempt to break lines at better positions
    * Use "override" in more places, don't use "virtual" with it
    * Use {} where the body is more than one line
    * Make declaration and definition arg names match
    * Eliminate unused code
    * EXPECT_EQ(expected, actual) (but use (actual, expected) for e.g. _GT)
    * Correct #include order
    * Use anonymous namespaces in preference to "static" for file-scoping
    * Eliminate unnecessary casts
    * Update reference code in comments of ARM assembly sources to match actual current C code
    * Fix indenting to be more style-guide compliant
    * Use arraysize() in more places
    * Use bool instead of int for "boolean" values (0/1)
    * Shorten and simplify code
    * Spaces around operators
    * 80 column limit
    * Use const more consistently
    * Space goes after '*' in type name, not before
    * Remove unnecessary return values
    * Use "(var == const)", not "(const == var)"
    * Spelling
    * Prefer true, typed constants to "enum hack" constants
    * Avoid "virtual" on non-overridden functions
    * ASSERT(x == y) -> ASSERT_EQ(y, x)

    Adding support for OpenSL ES output in native WebRTC
    
    BUG=4573,2982,2175,3590
    TEST=modules_unittests --gtest_filter=AudioDevice*, AppRTCDemo and WebRTCDemo
    
    Summary:
    
    - Removes dependency of the 'enable_android_opensl' compiler flag.
      Instead, OpenSL ES is always supported, and will enabled for devices that
      supports low-latency output.
    - WebRTC no longer supports OpenSL ES for the input/recording side.
    - Removes old code and demos using OpenSL ES for audio input.
    - Improves accuracy of total delay estimates (better AEC performance).
    - Reduces roundtrip audio latency; especially when OpenSL can be used.
    
    Performance verified on: Nexus 5, 6, 7 and 9. Samsung Galaxy S4 and S6.
    Android One device.

    Adding playout volume control to WebRtcAudioTrack.java.
    
    Also adds a framework for an AudioManager to be used by both sides (playout and recording).
    This initial implementation only does very simple tasks like setting up the correct audio
    mode (needed for correct volume behavior). Note that this CL is mainly about modifying
    the volume. The added AudioManager is only a place holder for future work. I could have
    done the same parts in the WebRtcAudioTrack class but feel that it is better to move these
    parts to an AudioManager already at this stage.
    
    The AudioManager supports Init() where actual audio changes are done (set audio mode etc.)
    but it can also be used a simple "construct-and-store-audio-parameters" unit, which is the
    case here. Hence, the AM now serves as the center for getting audio parameters and then inject
    these into playout and recording sides. Previously, both sides acquired their own parameters
    and that is more error prone.

    Refactoring WebRTC Java/JNI audio track in C++ and Java.
    
    This CL is part II in a major refactoring effort. See https://webrtc-codereview.appspot.com/33969004 for part I.
    
    - Removes unused code and old WEBRTC logging macros
    - Now uses optimal sample rate and buffer size in Java AudioTrack (used hard-coded sample rate before)
    - Makes code more inline with the implementation in Chrome
    - Adds helper methods for JNI handling to improve readability
    - Changes the threading model (high-prio audio thread now lives in Java-land and C++ only works as proxy)
    - Simplified the delay estimate
    - Adds basic thread checks
    - Removes all locks in C++ land
    - Removes all locks in Java
    - Improves construction/destruction
    - Additional cleanup
    
    Tested using AppRTCDemo and WebRTCDemo APKs on N6, N5, N7, Samsung Galaxy S4 and
    Samsung Galaxy S4 mini (which uses 44.1kHz as native sample rate).

    Add RTC_ prefix to (D)CHECKs and related macros.
    
    We must remove dependency on Chromium, i.e. we can't use Chromium's base/logging.h. That means we need to define these macros in WebRTC also when doing Chromium builds. And this causes redefinition.
    
    Alternative solutions:
    * Check if we already have defined e.g. CHECK, and don't define them in that case. This makes us depend on include order in Chromium, which is not acceptable.
    * Don't allow using the macros in WebRTC headers. Error prone since if someone adds it there by mistake it may compile fine, but later break if a header in added or order is changed in Chromium. That will be confusing and hard to enforce.
    * Ensure that headers that are included by an embedder don't include our macros. This would require some heavy refactoring to be maintainable and enforcable.
    * Changes in Chromium for this is obviously not an option.

    Update a ton of audio code to use size_t more correctly and in general reduce
    use of int16_t/uint16_t.
    
    This is the upshot of a recommendation by henrik.lundin and kwiberg on an original small change ( https://webrtc-codereview.appspot.com/42569004/#ps1 ) to stop using int16_t just because values could fit in it, and is similar in nature to a previous "mass change to use size_t more" ( https://webrtc-codereview.appspot.com/23129004/ ) which also needed to be split up for review but to land all at once, since, like adding "const", such changes tend to cause a lot of transitive effects.
    
    This was be reviewed and approved in pieces:

    Adding support for OpenSL ES output in native WebRTC
    
    BUG=4573,2982,2175,3590
    TEST=modules_unittests --gtest_filter=AudioDevice*, AppRTCDemo and WebRTCDemo
    
    Summary:
    
    - Removes dependency of the 'enable_android_opensl' compiler flag.
      Instead, OpenSL ES is always supported, and will enabled for devices that
      supports low-latency output.
    - WebRTC no longer supports OpenSL ES for the input/recording side.
    - Removes old code and demos using OpenSL ES for audio input.
    - Improves accuracy of total delay estimates (better AEC performance).
    - Reduces roundtrip audio latency; especially when OpenSL can be used.
    
    Performance verified on: Nexus 5, 6, 7 and 9. Samsung Galaxy S4 and S6.
    Android One device.

    Adding playout volume control to WebRtcAudioTrack.java.
    
    Also adds a framework for an AudioManager to be used by both sides (playout and recording).
    This initial implementation only does very simple tasks like setting up the correct audio
    mode (needed for correct volume behavior). Note that this CL is mainly about modifying
    the volume. The added AudioManager is only a place holder for future work. I could have
    done the same parts in the WebRtcAudioTrack class but feel that it is better to move these
    parts to an AudioManager already at this stage.
    
    The AudioManager supports Init() where actual audio changes are done (set audio mode etc.)
    but it can also be used a simple "construct-and-store-audio-parameters" unit, which is the
    case here. Hence, the AM now serves as the center for getting audio parameters and then inject
    these into playout and recording sides. Previously, both sides acquired their own parameters
    and that is more error prone.

    Adds C++/JNI/Java unit test for audio device module on Android.
    
    This CL adds support for unittests of the AudioDeviceModule on Android using both Java and C++. The new framework uses ::testing::TesWithParam to support both Java-based audio and OpenSL ES based audio. However, given existing issues in our OpenSL ES implementation, the list of test parameters only contains Java in this first version. Open SL ES will be enabled as soon as the backend has been refactored.
    
    It also:
    
    - Removes the redundant JNIEnv* argument in webrtc::VoiceEngine::SetAndroidObjects().
    - Modifies usage of enable_android_opensl and the WEBRTC_ANDROID_OPENSLES define.
    - Adds kAndroidJavaAudio and kAndroidOpenSLESAudio to AudioLayer enumerator.
    - Fixes some bugs which were discovered when running the tests.

    Refactoring WebRTC Java/JNI audio track in C++ and Java.
    
    This CL is part II in a major refactoring effort. See https://webrtc-codereview.appspot.com/33969004 for part I.
    
    - Removes unused code and old WEBRTC logging macros
    - Now uses optimal sample rate and buffer size in Java AudioTrack (used hard-coded sample rate before)
    - Makes code more inline with the implementation in Chrome
    - Adds helper methods for JNI handling to improve readability
    - Changes the threading model (high-prio audio thread now lives in Java-land and C++ only works as proxy)
    - Simplified the delay estimate
    - Adds basic thread checks
    - Removes all locks in C++ land
    - Removes all locks in Java
    - Improves construction/destruction
    - Additional cleanup
    
    Tested using AppRTCDemo and WebRTCDemo APKs on N6, N5, N7, Samsung Galaxy S4 and
    Samsung Galaxy S4 mini (which uses 44.1kHz as native sample rate).

    Add RTC_ prefix to (D)CHECKs and related macros.
    
    We must remove dependency on Chromium, i.e. we can't use Chromium's base/logging.h. That means we need to define these macros in WebRTC also when doing Chromium builds. And this causes redefinition.
    
    Alternative solutions:
    * Check if we already have defined e.g. CHECK, and don't define them in that case. This makes us depend on include order in Chromium, which is not acceptable.
    * Don't allow using the macros in WebRTC headers. Error prone since if someone adds it there by mistake it may compile fine, but later break if a header in added or order is changed in Chromium. That will be confusing and hard to enforce.
    * Ensure that headers that are included by an embedder don't include our macros. This would require some heavy refactoring to be maintainable and enforcable.
    * Changes in Chromium for this is obviously not an option.

    Adding support for OpenSL ES output in native WebRTC
    
    BUG=4573,2982,2175,3590
    TEST=modules_unittests --gtest_filter=AudioDevice*, AppRTCDemo and WebRTCDemo
    
    Summary:
    
    - Removes dependency of the 'enable_android_opensl' compiler flag.
      Instead, OpenSL ES is always supported, and will enabled for devices that
      supports low-latency output.
    - WebRTC no longer supports OpenSL ES for the input/recording side.
    - Removes old code and demos using OpenSL ES for audio input.
    - Improves accuracy of total delay estimates (better AEC performance).
    - Reduces roundtrip audio latency; especially when OpenSL can be used.
    
    Performance verified on: Nexus 5, 6, 7 and 9. Samsung Galaxy S4 and S6.

    Adding playout volume control to WebRtcAudioTrack.java.
    
    Also adds a framework for an AudioManager to be used by both sides (playout and recording).
    This initial implementation only does very simple tasks like setting up the correct audio
    mode (needed for correct volume behavior). Note that this CL is mainly about modifying
    the volume. The added AudioManager is only a place holder for future work. I could have
    done the same parts in the WebRtcAudioTrack class but feel that it is better to move these
    parts to an AudioManager already at this stage.
    
    The AudioManager supports Init() where actual audio changes are done (set audio mode etc.)
    but it can also be used a simple "construct-and-store-audio-parameters" unit, which is the
    case here. Hence, the AM now serves as the center for getting audio parameters and then inject
    these into playout and recording sides. Previously, both sides acquired their own parameters
    and that is more error prone.

    Add RTC_ prefix to (D)CHECKs and related macros.
    
    We must remove dependency on Chromium, i.e. we can't use Chromium's base/logging.h. That means we need to define these macros in WebRTC also when doing Chromium builds. And this causes redefinition.
    
    Alternative solutions:
    * Check if we already have defined e.g. CHECK, and don't define them in that case. This makes us depend on include order in Chromium, which is not acceptable.
    * Don't allow using the macros in WebRTC headers. Error prone since if someone adds it there by mistake it may compile fine, but later break if a header in added or order is changed in Chromium. That will be confusing and hard to enforce.
    * Ensure that headers that are included by an embedder don't include our macros. This would require some heavy refactoring to be maintainable and enforcable.
    * Changes in Chromium for this is obviously not an option.

    Update a ton of audio code to use size_t more correctly and in general reduce
    use of int16_t/uint16_t.
    
    This is the upshot of a recommendation by henrik.lundin and kwiberg on an original small change ( https://webrtc-codereview.appspot.com/42569004/#ps1 ) to stop using int16_t just because values could fit in it, and is similar in nature to a previous "mass change to use size_t more" ( https://webrtc-codereview.appspot.com/23129004/ ) which also needed to be split up for review but to land all at once, since, like adding "const", such changes tend to cause a lot of transitive effects.

    Adds C++/JNI/Java unit test for audio device module on Android.
    
    This CL adds support for unittests of the AudioDeviceModule on Android using both Java and C++. The new framework uses ::testing::TesWithParam to support both Java-based audio and OpenSL ES based audio. However, given existing issues in our OpenSL ES implementation, the list of test parameters only contains Java in this first version. Open SL ES will be enabled as soon as the backend has been refactored.
    
    It also:
    
    - Removes the redundant JNIEnv* argument in webrtc::VoiceEngine::SetAndroidObjects().
    - Modifies usage of enable_android_opensl and the WEBRTC_ANDROID_OPENSLES define.
    - Adds kAndroidJavaAudio and kAndroidOpenSLESAudio to AudioLayer enumerator.
    - Fixes some bugs which were discovered when running the tests.

    Adds C++/JNI/Java unit test for audio device module on Android.
    
    This CL adds support for unittests of the AudioDeviceModule on Android using both Java and C++. The new framework uses ::testing::TesWithParam to support both Java-based audio and OpenSL ES based audio. However, given existing issues in our OpenSL ES implementation, the list of test parameters only contains Java in this first version. Open SL ES will be enabled as soon as the backend has been refactored.

    Refactoring WebRTC Java/JNI audio track in C++ and Java.
    
    This CL is part II in a major refactoring effort. See https://webrtc-codereview.appspot.com/33969004 for part I.
    
    - Removes unused code and old WEBRTC logging macros
    - Now uses optimal sample rate and buffer size in Java AudioTrack (used hard-coded sample rate before)
    - Makes code more inline with the implementation in Chrome
    - Adds helper methods for JNI handling to improve readability
    - Changes the threading model (high-prio audio thread now lives in Java-land and C++ only works as proxy)
    - Simplified the delay estimate
    - Adds basic thread checks
    - Removes all locks in C++ land
    - Removes all locks in Java
    - Improves construction/destruction
    - Additional cleanup
    
    Tested using AppRTCDemo and WebRTCDemo APKs on N6, N5, N7, Samsung Galaxy S4 and
    Samsung Galaxy S4 mini (which uses 44.1kHz as native sample rate).

    Add RTC_ prefix to (D)CHECKs and related macros.
    
    We must remove dependency on Chromium, i.e. we can't use Chromium's base/logging.h. That means we need to define these macros in WebRTC also when doing Chromium builds. And this causes redefinition.
    
    Alternative solutions:
    * Check if we already have defined e.g. CHECK, and don't define them in that case. This makes us depend on include order in Chromium, which is not acceptable.
    * Don't allow using the macros in WebRTC headers. Error prone since if someone adds it there by mistake it may compile fine, but later break if a header in added or order is changed in Chromium. That will be confusing and hard to enforce.
    * Ensure that headers that are included by an embedder don't include our macros. This would require some heavy refactoring to be maintainable and enforcable.
    * Changes in Chromium for this is obviously not an option.

    Update a ton of audio code to use size_t more correctly and in general reduce

    This is the upshot of a recommendation by henrik.lundin and kwiberg on an original small change ( https://webrtc-codereview.appspot.com/42569004/#ps1 ) to stop using int16_t just because values could fit in it, and is similar in nature to a previous "mass change to use size_t more" ( https://webrtc-codereview.appspot.com/23129004/ ) which also needed to be split up for review but to land all at once, since, like adding "const", such changes tend to cause a lot of transitive effects.

    Adding support for OpenSL ES output in native WebRTC
    
    BUG=4573,2982,2175,3590
    TEST=modules_unittests --gtest_filter=AudioDevice*, AppRTCDemo and WebRTCDemo
    
    Summary:
    
    - Removes dependency of the 'enable_android_opensl' compiler flag.
      Instead, OpenSL ES is always supported, and will enabled for devices that
      supports low-latency output.
    - WebRTC no longer supports OpenSL ES for the input/recording side.
    - Removes old code and demos using OpenSL ES for audio input.
    - Improves accuracy of total delay estimates (better AEC performance).
    - Reduces roundtrip audio latency; especially when OpenSL can be used.
    
    Performance verified on: Nexus 5, 6, 7 and 9. Samsung Galaxy S4 and S6.

    Adding playout volume control to WebRtcAudioTrack.java.
    
    Also adds a framework for an AudioManager to be used by both sides (playout and recording).
    This initial implementation only does very simple tasks like setting up the correct audio
    mode (needed for correct volume behavior). Note that this CL is mainly about modifying
    the volume. The added AudioManager is only a place holder for future work. I could have
    done the same parts in the WebRtcAudioTrack class but feel that it is better to move these
    parts to an AudioManager already at this stage.
    
    The AudioManager supports Init() where actual audio changes are done (set audio mode etc.)
    but it can also be used a simple "construct-and-store-audio-parameters" unit, which is the
    case here. Hence, the AM now serves as the center for getting audio parameters and then inject
    these into playout and recording sides. Previously, both sides acquired their own parameters
    and that is more error prone.

    Adds C++/JNI/Java unit test for audio device module on Android.
    
    This CL adds support for unittests of the AudioDeviceModule on Android using both Java and C++. The new framework uses ::testing::TesWithParam to support both Java-based audio and OpenSL ES based audio. However, given existing issues in our OpenSL ES implementation, the list of test parameters only contains Java in this first version. Open SL ES will be enabled as soon as the backend has been refactored.
    
    It also:
    
    - Removes the redundant JNIEnv* argument in webrtc::VoiceEngine::SetAndroidObjects().
    - Modifies usage of enable_android_opensl and the WEBRTC_ANDROID_OPENSLES define.
    - Adds kAndroidJavaAudio and kAndroidOpenSLESAudio to AudioLayer enumerator.
    - Fixes some bugs which were discovered when running the tests.

    Add RTC_ prefix to (D)CHECKs and related macros.
    
    We must remove dependency on Chromium, i.e. we can't use Chromium's base/logging.h. That means we need to define these macros in WebRTC also when doing Chromium builds. And this causes redefinition.
    
    Alternative solutions:
    * Check if we already have defined e.g. CHECK, and don't define them in that case. This makes us depend on include order in Chromium, which is not acceptable.
    * Don't allow using the macros in WebRTC headers. Error prone since if someone adds it there by mistake it may compile fine, but later break if a header in added or order is changed in Chromium. That will be confusing and hard to enforce.
    * Ensure that headers that are included by an embedder don't include our macros. This would require some heavy refactoring to be maintainable and enforcable.
    * Changes in Chromium for this is obviously not an option.

    BUG=4573,2982,2175,3590
    TEST=modules_unittests --gtest_filter=AudioDevice*, AppRTCDemo and WebRTCDemo
    
    Summary:
    
    - Removes dependency of the 'enable_android_opensl' compiler flag.
      Instead, OpenSL ES is always supported, and will enabled for devices that
      supports low-latency output.
    - WebRTC no longer supports OpenSL ES for the input/recording side.
    - Removes old code and demos using OpenSL ES for audio input.
    - Improves accuracy of total delay estimates (better AEC performance).
    - Reduces roundtrip audio latency; especially when OpenSL can be used.
    
    Performance verified on: Nexus 5, 6, 7 and 9. Samsung Galaxy S4 and S6.
    Android One device.

    Adding playout volume control to WebRtcAudioTrack.java.
    
    Also adds a framework for an AudioManager to be used by both sides (playout and recording).
    This initial implementation only does very simple tasks like setting up the correct audio
    mode (needed for correct volume behavior). Note that this CL is mainly about modifying
    the volume. The added AudioManager is only a place holder for future work. I could have
    done the same parts in the WebRtcAudioTrack class but feel that it is better to move these
    parts to an AudioManager already at this stage.
    
    The AudioManager supports Init() where actual audio changes are done (set audio mode etc.)
    but it can also be used a simple "construct-and-store-audio-parameters" unit, which is the
    case here. Hence, the AM now serves as the center for getting audio parameters and then inject
    these into playout and recording sides. Previously, both sides acquired their own parameters
    and that is more error prone.

    Adds C++/JNI/Java unit test for audio device module on Android.
    
    This CL adds support for unittests of the AudioDeviceModule on Android using both Java and C++. The new framework uses ::testing::TesWithParam to support both Java-based audio and OpenSL ES based audio. However, given existing issues in our OpenSL ES implementation, the list of test parameters only contains Java in this first version. Open SL ES will be enabled as soon as the backend has been refactored.
    
    It also:
    
    - Removes the redundant JNIEnv* argument in webrtc::VoiceEngine::SetAndroidObjects().
    - Modifies usage of enable_android_opensl and the WEBRTC_ANDROID_OPENSLES define.
    - Adds kAndroidJavaAudio and kAndroidOpenSLESAudio to AudioLayer enumerator.
    - Fixes some bugs which were discovered when running the tests.

    Refactoring WebRTC Java/JNI audio track in C++ and Java.
    
    This CL is part II in a major refactoring effort. See https://webrtc-codereview.appspot.com/33969004 for part I.
    
    - Removes unused code and old WEBRTC logging macros
    - Now uses optimal sample rate and buffer size in Java AudioTrack (used hard-coded sample rate before)
    - Makes code more inline with the implementation in Chrome
    - Adds helper methods for JNI handling to improve readability
    - Changes the threading model (high-prio audio thread now lives in Java-land and C++ only works as proxy)
    - Simplified the delay estimate
    - Adds basic thread checks
    - Removes all locks in C++ land
    - Removes all locks in Java
    - Improves construction/destruction
    - Additional cleanup
    
    Tested using AppRTCDemo and WebRTCDemo APKs on N6, N5, N7, Samsung Galaxy S4 and
    Samsung Galaxy S4 mini (which uses 44.1kHz as native sample rate).

    Add RTC_ prefix to (D)CHECKs and related macros.
    
    We must remove dependency on Chromium, i.e. we can't use Chromium's base/logging.h. That means we need to define these macros in WebRTC also when doing Chromium builds. And this causes redefinition.
    
    Alternative solutions:
    * Check if we already have defined e.g. CHECK, and don't define them in that case. This makes us depend on include order in Chromium, which is not acceptable.
    * Don't allow using the macros in WebRTC headers. Error prone since if someone adds it there by mistake it may compile fine, but later break if a header in added or order is changed in Chromium. That will be confusing and hard to enforce.
    * Ensure that headers that are included by an embedder don't include our macros. This would require some heavy refactoring to be maintainable and enforcable.
    * Changes in Chromium for this is obviously not an option.

    Adding support for OpenSL ES output in native WebRTC
    
    BUG=4573,2982,2175,3590
    TEST=modules_unittests --gtest_filter=AudioDevice*, AppRTCDemo and WebRTCDemo
    
    Summary:
    
    - Removes dependency of the 'enable_android_opensl' compiler flag.
      Instead, OpenSL ES is always supported, and will enabled for devices that
      supports low-latency output.
    - WebRTC no longer supports OpenSL ES for the input/recording side.
    - Removes old code and demos using OpenSL ES for audio input.
    - Improves accuracy of total delay estimates (better AEC performance).
    - Reduces roundtrip audio latency; especially when OpenSL can be used.
    
    Performance verified on: Nexus 5, 6, 7 and 9. Samsung Galaxy S4 and S6.
    Android One device.

    Adding playout volume control to WebRtcAudioTrack.java.
    
    Also adds a framework for an AudioManager to be used by both sides (playout and recording).
    This initial implementation only does very simple tasks like setting up the correct audio
    mode (needed for correct volume behavior). Note that this CL is mainly about modifying
    the volume. The added AudioManager is only a place holder for future work. I could have
    done the same parts in the WebRtcAudioTrack class but feel that it is better to move these
    parts to an AudioManager already at this stage.
    
    The AudioManager supports Init() where actual audio changes are done (set audio mode etc.)
    but it can also be used a simple "construct-and-store-audio-parameters" unit, which is the
    case here. Hence, the AM now serves as the center for getting audio parameters and then inject
    these into playout and recording sides. Previously, both sides acquired their own parameters
    and that is more error prone.

    Adds C++/JNI/Java unit test for audio device module on Android.
    
    This CL adds support for unittests of the AudioDeviceModule on Android using both Java and C++. The new framework uses ::testing::TesWithParam to support both Java-based audio and OpenSL ES based audio. However, given existing issues in our OpenSL ES implementation, the list of test parameters only contains Java in this first version. Open SL ES will be enabled as soon as the backend has been refactored.
    
    It also:
    
    - Removes the redundant JNIEnv* argument in webrtc::VoiceEngine::SetAndroidObjects().
    - Modifies usage of enable_android_opensl and the WEBRTC_ANDROID_OPENSLES define.
    - Adds kAndroidJavaAudio and kAndroidOpenSLESAudio to AudioLayer enumerator.
    - Fixes some bugs which were discovered when running the tests.

    Refactoring WebRTC Java/JNI audio track in C++ and Java.
    
    This CL is part II in a major refactoring effort. See https://webrtc-codereview.appspot.com/33969004 for part I.
    
    - Removes unused code and old WEBRTC logging macros
    - Now uses optimal sample rate and buffer size in Java AudioTrack (used hard-coded sample rate before)
    - Makes code more inline with the implementation in Chrome
    - Adds helper methods for JNI handling to improve readability
    - Changes the threading model (high-prio audio thread now lives in Java-land and C++ only works as proxy)
    - Simplified the delay estimate
    - Adds basic thread checks
    - Removes all locks in C++ land
    - Removes all locks in Java
    - Improves construction/destruction
    - Additional cleanup
    
    Tested using AppRTCDemo and WebRTCDemo APKs on N6, N5, N7, Samsung Galaxy S4 and
    Samsung Galaxy S4 mini (which uses 44.1kHz as native sample rate).

    BUG=4573,2982,2175,3590
    TEST=modules_unittests --gtest_filter=AudioDevice*, AppRTCDemo and WebRTCDemo
    
    Summary:
    
    - Removes dependency of the 'enable_android_opensl' compiler flag.
      Instead, OpenSL ES is always supported, and will enabled for devices that
      supports low-latency output.
    - WebRTC no longer supports OpenSL ES for the input/recording side.
    - Removes old code and demos using OpenSL ES for audio input.
    - Improves accuracy of total delay estimates (better AEC performance).
    - Reduces roundtrip audio latency; especially when OpenSL can be used.
    
    Performance verified on: Nexus 5, 6, 7 and 9. Samsung Galaxy S4 and S6.
    Android One device.

    Adding playout volume control to WebRtcAudioTrack.java.
    
    Also adds a framework for an AudioManager to be used by both sides (playout and recording).
    This initial implementation only does very simple tasks like setting up the correct audio
    mode (needed for correct volume behavior). Note that this CL is mainly about modifying
    the volume. The added AudioManager is only a place holder for future work. I could have
    done the same parts in the WebRtcAudioTrack class but feel that it is better to move these
    parts to an AudioManager already at this stage.
    
    The AudioManager supports Init() where actual audio changes are done (set audio mode etc.)
    but it can also be used a simple "construct-and-store-audio-parameters" unit, which is the
    case here. Hence, the AM now serves as the center for getting audio parameters and then inject
    these into playout and recording sides. Previously, both sides acquired their own parameters
    and that is more error prone.

    Add RTC_ prefix to (D)CHECKs and related macros.
    
    We must remove dependency on Chromium, i.e. we can't use Chromium's base/logging.h. That means we need to define these macros in WebRTC also when doing Chromium builds. And this causes redefinition.
    
    Alternative solutions:
    * Check if we already have defined e.g. CHECK, and don't define them in that case. This makes us depend on include order in Chromium, which is not acceptable.
    * Don't allow using the macros in WebRTC headers. Error prone since if someone adds it there by mistake it may compile fine, but later break if a header in added or order is changed in Chromium. That will be confusing and hard to enforce.
    * Ensure that headers that are included by an embedder don't include our macros. This would require some heavy refactoring to be maintainable and enforcable.
    * Changes in Chromium for this is obviously not an option.

    This is the upshot of a recommendation by henrik.lundin and kwiberg on an original small change ( https://webrtc-codereview.appspot.com/42569004/#ps1 ) to stop using int16_t just because values could fit in it, and is similar in nature to a previous "mass change to use size_t more" ( https://webrtc-codereview.appspot.com/23129004/ ) which also needed to be split up for review but to land all at once, since, like adding "const", such changes tend to cause a lot of transitive effects.

    Adding support for OpenSL ES output in native WebRTC
    
    BUG=4573,2982,2175,3590
    TEST=modules_unittests --gtest_filter=AudioDevice*, AppRTCDemo and WebRTCDemo
    
    Summary:
    
    - Removes dependency of the 'enable_android_opensl' compiler flag.
      Instead, OpenSL ES is always supported, and will enabled for devices that
      supports low-latency output.
    - WebRTC no longer supports OpenSL ES for the input/recording side.
    - Removes old code and demos using OpenSL ES for audio input.
    - Improves accuracy of total delay estimates (better AEC performance).
    - Reduces roundtrip audio latency; especially when OpenSL can be used.
    
    Performance verified on: Nexus 5, 6, 7 and 9. Samsung Galaxy S4 and S6.
    Android One device.

    Adding playout volume control to WebRtcAudioTrack.java.
    
    Also adds a framework for an AudioManager to be used by both sides (playout and recording).
    This initial implementation only does very simple tasks like setting up the correct audio
    mode (needed for correct volume behavior). Note that this CL is mainly about modifying
    the volume. The added AudioManager is only a place holder for future work. I could have
    done the same parts in the WebRtcAudioTrack class but feel that it is better to move these
    parts to an AudioManager already at this stage.
    
    The AudioManager supports Init() where actual audio changes are done (set audio mode etc.)
    but it can also be used a simple "construct-and-store-audio-parameters" unit, which is the
    case here. Hence, the AM now serves as the center for getting audio parameters and then inject
    these into playout and recording sides. Previously, both sides acquired their own parameters
    and that is more error prone.

    Adds C++/JNI/Java unit test for audio device module on Android.
    
    This CL adds support for unittests of the AudioDeviceModule on Android using both Java and C++. The new framework uses ::testing::TesWithParam to support both Java-based audio and OpenSL ES based audio. However, given existing issues in our OpenSL ES implementation, the list of test parameters only contains Java in this first version. Open SL ES will be enabled as soon as the backend has been refactored.
    
    It also:
    
    - Removes the redundant JNIEnv* argument in webrtc::VoiceEngine::SetAndroidObjects().
    - Modifies usage of enable_android_opensl and the WEBRTC_ANDROID_OPENSLES define.
    - Adds kAndroidJavaAudio and kAndroidOpenSLESAudio to AudioLayer enumerator.
    - Fixes some bugs which were discovered when running the tests.

    Refactoring WebRTC Java/JNI audio track in C++ and Java.
    
    This CL is part II in a major refactoring effort. See https://webrtc-codereview.appspot.com/33969004 for part I.
    
    - Removes unused code and old WEBRTC logging macros
    - Now uses optimal sample rate and buffer size in Java AudioTrack (used hard-coded sample rate before)
    - Makes code more inline with the implementation in Chrome
    - Adds helper methods for JNI handling to improve readability
    - Changes the threading model (high-prio audio thread now lives in Java-land and C++ only works as proxy)
    - Simplified the delay estimate
    - Adds basic thread checks
    - Removes all locks in C++ land
    - Removes all locks in Java
    - Improves construction/destruction
    - Additional cleanup
    
    Tested using AppRTCDemo and WebRTCDemo APKs on N6, N5, N7, Samsung Galaxy S4 and
    Samsung Galaxy S4 mini (which uses 44.1kHz as native sample rate).

    Add RTC_ prefix to (D)CHECKs and related macros.
    
    We must remove dependency on Chromium, i.e. we can't use Chromium's base/logging.h. That means we need to define these macros in WebRTC also when doing Chromium builds. And this causes redefinition.
    
    Alternative solutions:
    * Check if we already have defined e.g. CHECK, and don't define them in that case. This makes us depend on include order in Chromium, which is not acceptable.
    * Don't allow using the macros in WebRTC headers. Error prone since if someone adds it there by mistake it may compile fine, but later break if a header in added or order is changed in Chromium. That will be confusing and hard to enforce.
    * Ensure that headers that are included by an embedder don't include our macros. This would require some heavy refactoring to be maintainable and enforcable.
    * Changes in Chromium for this is obviously not an option.

    Refactor the AudioDevice for iOS and improve the performance and stability
    
    This CL contains major modifications of the audio output parts for WebRTC on iOS:
    - general code cleanup
    - improves thread handling (added thread checks, remove critical section, atomic ops etc.)
    - reduces loopback latency of iPhone 6 from ~90ms to ~60ms ;-)
    - improves selection of audio parameters on iOS
    - reduces complexity by removing complex and redundant delay estimates
    - now instead uses fixed delay estimates if for some reason the SW EAC must be used
    - adds AudioFineBuffer to compensate for differences in native output buffer size and
      the 10ms size used by WebRTC. Same class as is used today on Android and we have unit tests for
      this class (the old code was buggy and we have several issue reports of crashes related to it)
    
    Similar improvements will be done for the recording sid as well in a separate CL.
    I will also add support for 48kHz in an upcoming CL since that will improve Opus performance.

    These changes stem from requests by Andrew on https://codereview.webrtc.org/1228823002/ to eliminate some "return -1"s and change to using asserts plus returning size_ts.  I then also converted the relevant connected bits.

    - Removes dependency of the 'enable_android_opensl' compiler flag.
      Instead, OpenSL ES is always supported, and will enabled for devices that
      supports low-latency output.
    - WebRTC no longer supports OpenSL ES for the input/recording side.
    - Removes old code and demos using OpenSL ES for audio input.
    - Improves accuracy of total delay estimates (better AEC performance).
    - Reduces roundtrip audio latency; especially when OpenSL can be used.

    Update a ton of audio code to use size_t more correctly and in general reduce
    use of int16_t/uint16_t.
    
    This is the upshot of a recommendation by henrik.lundin and kwiberg on an original small change ( https://webrtc-codereview.appspot.com/42569004/#ps1 ) to stop using int16_t just because values could fit in it, and is similar in nature to a previous "mass change to use size_t more" ( https://webrtc-codereview.appspot.com/23129004/ ) which also needed to be split up for review but to land all at once, since, like adding "const", such changes tend to cause a lot of transitive effects.

    Add RTC_ prefix to (D)CHECKs and related macros.
    
    We must remove dependency on Chromium, i.e. we can't use Chromium's base/logging.h. That means we need to define these macros in WebRTC also when doing Chromium builds. And this causes redefinition.
    
    Alternative solutions:
    * Check if we already have defined e.g. CHECK, and don't define them in that case. This makes us depend on include order in Chromium, which is not acceptable.
    * Don't allow using the macros in WebRTC headers. Error prone since if someone adds it there by mistake it may compile fine, but later break if a header in added or order is changed in Chromium. That will be confusing and hard to enforce.
    * Ensure that headers that are included by an embedder don't include our macros. This would require some heavy refactoring to be maintainable and enforcable.
    * Changes in Chromium for this is obviously not an option.

    Convert some more things to size_t.
    
    These changes stem from requests by Andrew on https://codereview.webrtc.org/1228823002/ to eliminate some "return -1"s and change to using asserts plus returning size_ts.  I then also converted the relevant connected bits.
    
    This also cleans up a bunch of style issues, e.g. no spaces around operators.

    Adding support for OpenSL ES output in native WebRTC
    
    BUG=4573,2982,2175,3590
    TEST=modules_unittests --gtest_filter=AudioDevice*, AppRTCDemo and WebRTCDemo
    
    Summary:
    
    - Removes dependency of the 'enable_android_opensl' compiler flag.
      Instead, OpenSL ES is always supported, and will enabled for devices that
      supports low-latency output.
    - WebRTC no longer supports OpenSL ES for the input/recording side.
    - Removes old code and demos using OpenSL ES for audio input.
    - Improves accuracy of total delay estimates (better AEC performance).
    - Reduces roundtrip audio latency; especially when OpenSL can be used.
    
    Performance verified on: Nexus 5, 6, 7 and 9. Samsung Galaxy S4 and S6.
    Android One device.

      Instead, OpenSL ES is always supported, and will enabled for devices that
      supports low-latency output.
    - WebRTC no longer supports OpenSL ES for the input/recording side.
    - Removes old code and demos using OpenSL ES for audio input.
    - Improves accuracy of total delay estimates (better AEC performance).
    - Reduces roundtrip audio latency; especially when OpenSL can be used.

    Adding playout volume control to WebRtcAudioTrack.java.
    
    Also adds a framework for an AudioManager to be used by both sides (playout and recording).
    This initial implementation only does very simple tasks like setting up the correct audio
    mode (needed for correct volume behavior). Note that this CL is mainly about modifying
    the volume. The added AudioManager is only a place holder for future work. I could have
    done the same parts in the WebRtcAudioTrack class but feel that it is better to move these
    parts to an AudioManager already at this stage.
    
    The AudioManager supports Init() where actual audio changes are done (set audio mode etc.)
    but it can also be used a simple "construct-and-store-audio-parameters" unit, which is the
    case here. Hence, the AM now serves as the center for getting audio parameters and then inject
    these into playout and recording sides. Previously, both sides acquired their own parameters
    and that is more error prone.

    Summary:
    
    - Removes dependency of the 'enable_android_opensl' compiler flag.
      Instead, OpenSL ES is always supported, and will enabled for devices that
      supports low-latency output.
    - WebRTC no longer supports OpenSL ES for the input/recording side.
    - Removes old code and demos using OpenSL ES for audio input.
    - Improves accuracy of total delay estimates (better AEC performance).
    - Reduces roundtrip audio latency; especially when OpenSL can be used.

    This CL is part II in a major refactoring effort. See https://webrtc-codereview.appspot.com/33969004 for part I.
    
    - Removes unused code and old WEBRTC logging macros
    - Now uses optimal sample rate and buffer size in Java AudioTrack (used hard-coded sample rate before)
    - Makes code more inline with the implementation in Chrome
    - Adds helper methods for JNI handling to improve readability
    - Changes the threading model (high-prio audio thread now lives in Java-land and C++ only works as proxy)
    - Simplified the delay estimate
    - Adds basic thread checks
    - Removes all locks in C++ land
    - Removes all locks in Java
    - Improves construction/destruction
    - Additional cleanup
    
    Tested using AppRTCDemo and WebRTCDemo APKs on N6, N5, N7, Samsung Galaxy S4 and
    Samsung Galaxy S4 mini (which uses 44.1kHz as native sample rate).

    Adding playout volume control to WebRtcAudioTrack.java.
    
    Also adds a framework for an AudioManager to be used by both sides (playout and recording).
    This initial implementation only does very simple tasks like setting up the correct audio
    mode (needed for correct volume behavior). Note that this CL is mainly about modifying
    the volume. The added AudioManager is only a place holder for future work. I could have
    done the same parts in the WebRtcAudioTrack class but feel that it is better to move these
    parts to an AudioManager already at this stage.
    
    The AudioManager supports Init() where actual audio changes are done (set audio mode etc.)
    but it can also be used a simple "construct-and-store-audio-parameters" unit, which is the
    case here. Hence, the AM now serves as the center for getting audio parameters and then inject
    these into playout and recording sides. Previously, both sides acquired their own parameters
    and that is more error prone.

    Adding playout volume control to WebRtcAudioTrack.java.
    
    Also adds a framework for an AudioManager to be used by both sides (playout and recording).
    This initial implementation only does very simple tasks like setting up the correct audio
    mode (needed for correct volume behavior). Note that this CL is mainly about modifying
    the volume. The added AudioManager is only a place holder for future work. I could have
    done the same parts in the WebRtcAudioTrack class but feel that it is better to move these
    parts to an AudioManager already at this stage.
    
    The AudioManager supports Init() where actual audio changes are done (set audio mode etc.)
    but it can also be used a simple "construct-and-store-audio-parameters" unit, which is the
    case here. Hence, the AM now serves as the center for getting audio parameters and then inject
    these into playout and recording sides. Previously, both sides acquired their own parameters
    and that is more error prone.

    New AudioTrack implementation now works on pre-Lollipop devices.
    
    The previous version used an AudioTrack.write() implementation that required API Level 21. This is now fixed.

    Refactoring WebRTC Java/JNI audio track in C++ and Java.
    
    This CL is part II in a major refactoring effort. See https://webrtc-codereview.appspot.com/33969004 for part I.
    
    - Removes unused code and old WEBRTC logging macros
    - Now uses optimal sample rate and buffer size in Java AudioTrack (used hard-coded sample rate before)
    - Makes code more inline with the implementation in Chrome
    - Adds helper methods for JNI handling to improve readability
    - Changes the threading model (high-prio audio thread now lives in Java-land and C++ only works as proxy)
    - Simplified the delay estimate
    - Adds basic thread checks
    - Removes all locks in C++ land
    - Removes all locks in Java
    - Improves construction/destruction
    - Additional cleanup
    
    Tested using AppRTCDemo and WebRTCDemo APKs on N6, N5, N7, Samsung Galaxy S4 and
    Samsung Galaxy S4 mini (which uses 44.1kHz as native sample rate).

    BUG=4573,2982,2175,3590
    TEST=modules_unittests --gtest_filter=AudioDevice*, AppRTCDemo and WebRTCDemo
    
    Summary:
    
    - Removes dependency of the 'enable_android_opensl' compiler flag.
      Instead, OpenSL ES is always supported, and will enabled for devices that
      supports low-latency output.
    - WebRTC no longer supports OpenSL ES for the input/recording side.
    - Removes old code and demos using OpenSL ES for audio input.
    - Improves accuracy of total delay estimates (better AEC performance).
    - Reduces roundtrip audio latency; especially when OpenSL can be used.
    
    Performance verified on: Nexus 5, 6, 7 and 9. Samsung Galaxy S4 and S6.
    Android One device.

    Adds C++/JNI/Java unit test for audio device module on Android.
    
    This CL adds support for unittests of the AudioDeviceModule on Android using both Java and C++. The new framework uses ::testing::TesWithParam to support both Java-based audio and OpenSL ES based audio. However, given existing issues in our OpenSL ES implementation, the list of test parameters only contains Java in this first version. Open SL ES will be enabled as soon as the backend has been refactored.
    
    It also:
    
    - Removes the redundant JNIEnv* argument in webrtc::VoiceEngine::SetAndroidObjects().
    - Modifies usage of enable_android_opensl and the WEBRTC_ANDROID_OPENSLES define.
    - Adds kAndroidJavaAudio and kAndroidOpenSLESAudio to AudioLayer enumerator.

    - Makes code more inline with the implementation in Chrome
    - Adds helper methods for JNI handling to improve readability
    - Changes the threading model (high-prio audio thread now lives in Java-land and C++ only works as proxy)
    - Simplified the delay estimate
    - Adds basic thread checks
    - Removes all locks in C++ land
    - Removes all locks in Java
    - Improves construction/destruction
    - Additional cleanup
    
    Tested using AppRTCDemo and WebRTCDemo APKs on N6, N5, N7, Samsung Galaxy S4 and
    Samsung Galaxy S4 mini (which uses 44.1kHz as native sample rate).

    Misc cleanups to webrtc/android code:
    - Replace some deprecated calls/enums with their more modern equivalents.
    - Clean up some usage of global data and/or hide it better
    - Catch specific exceptions instead of Exception, and log the exception instead
      of just its message.
    - Random log message cleanups
    - Added a build_with_libjingle gyp variable to mimic build_with_chromium for

    Switch C++-style C headers with their C equivalents.
    
    The C++ headers define the C functions within the std:: namespace, but
    we mainly don't use the std:: namespace for C functions. Therefore we
    should include the C headers.

There are a couple of methods there such as WaitForKey and GetTimeInMs that are used, but those methods aren't specific to audio and we have implementations of these elsewhere.

    Split EventWrapper in twain.
    I'm splitting the timer functions in EventWrapper into a separate interface.
    - Users of the timer functions have different needs than users of a generic event
    - Providing a default implementation for EventWrapper that simply uses rtc::Event.
    
    This means that clients of WebRTC that don't use the relatively few classes, typically rendering classes, that depend on the event timer functionality, also don't pull in dependencies on multimedia timers.

There are a couple of methods there such as WaitForKey and GetTimeInMs that are used, but those methods aren't specific to audio and we have implementations of these elsewhere.

    Split EventWrapper in twain.
    I'm splitting the timer functions in EventWrapper into a separate interface.
    - Users of the timer functions have different needs than users of a generic event
    - Providing a default implementation for EventWrapper that simply uses rtc::Event.
    
    This means that clients of WebRTC that don't use the relatively few classes, typically rendering classes, that depend on the event timer functionality, also don't pull in dependencies on multimedia timers.

    Fix win trybot errors due to r4729.
    
    The addition of logging.h in r4729 was causing the win trybot to fail
    with "#pragma deprecated" errors in standard library headers. This
    turned out to be due to including strsafe.h (via audio_device_config.h)
    before sstream (via logging.h).
    
    strsafe.h was only being included for the unused DEBUG_PRINT macro. I
    removed all references to it.
    
    This incidentally removes a bunch of other unneeded headers discovered
    while trying to track the problem down.
    
    This didn't show up in the commitbots; my guess is that the trybots are
    using the VC10 toolchain and the commitbots the VC11 toolchain.

    Add RTC_ prefix to (D)CHECKs and related macros.
    
    We must remove dependency on Chromium, i.e. we can't use Chromium's base/logging.h. That means we need to define these macros in WebRTC also when doing Chromium builds. And this causes redefinition.
    
    Alternative solutions:
    * Check if we already have defined e.g. CHECK, and don't define them in that case. This makes us depend on include order in Chromium, which is not acceptable.
    * Don't allow using the macros in WebRTC headers. Error prone since if someone adds it there by mistake it may compile fine, but later break if a header in added or order is changed in Chromium. That will be confusing and hard to enforce.
    * Ensure that headers that are included by an embedder don't include our macros. This would require some heavy refactoring to be maintainable and enforcable.
    * Changes in Chromium for this is obviously not an option.

    The class doesn't do anything in almost all cases except for grabbing and releasing locks + allocate memory.  There are a couple of methods there such as WaitForKey and GetTimeInMs that are used, but those methods aren't specific to audio and we have implementations of these elsewhere.  The third method, StringCompare isn't used anywhere (and also isn't specific to audio).

    Mac would force bluetooth playout working with 8kHz/1ch if capturing/rendering shares the same device, e.g. changing from 44.1kHz/2ch as default.
    So in the HandleStreamFormatChange() callback, we need to re-initiate the playout as same as what we do in InitPlayout(). Here we merely copy those codes out from InitPlayout() into a new SetDesiredPlayoutFormat() function for the invoking from the two places.
    Previously, HandleStreamFormatChange only re-creates the AudioConverter, which is not enough. We also need to reset the buffer size and refresh the latency.

    Remove thread id from ThreadWrapper::Start().
    
    Removes ThreadPosix::InitParams and a corresponding wait for an event.
    This unblocks ThreadPosix::Start which had to wait for thread scheduling
    for an event to trigger on the spawned thread, giving faster Start()

    Rewrite ThreadPosix.
    This is the same change as already made for Windows:
    https://webrtc-codereview.appspot.com/37069004/
    
    * Remove "dead" and "alive" variables.
    * Remove critical section
    * Remove implementation of SetNotAlive()
    * Always set thread name
    * Add thread checks for correct usage.
    
    * Changed AudioDeviceMac to create/start/stop/delete thread objects for playout and recording, inside the respective start and stop method.  The reason for this is because the AudioDeviceMac instance is currently being created on one thread and the above Start/Stop methods are being called on a different thread.  So, my change makes creation, start/stop, deletion of the thread objects always happen on the same thread.
    
    I'm making CurrentThreadId() in rtc_base_approved more visible so that it can be used  from there instead of inside webrtc. Down the line we will have more thread concepts in rtc_base_approved, so I put a TODO for myself to move this functionality to there once we do.

    Mac would force bluetooth playout working with 8kHz/1ch if capturing/rendering shares the same device, e.g. changing from 44.1kHz/2ch as default.
    So in the HandleStreamFormatChange() callback, we need to re-initiate the playout as same as what we do in InitPlayout(). Here we merely copy those codes out from InitPlayout() into a new SetDesiredPlayoutFormat() function for the invoking from the two places.
    Previously, HandleStreamFormatChange only re-creates the AudioConverter, which is not enough. We also need to reset the buffer size and refresh the latency.

    Remove thread id from ThreadWrapper::Start().
    
    Removes ThreadPosix::InitParams and a corresponding wait for an event.
    This unblocks ThreadPosix::Start which had to wait for thread scheduling
    for an event to trigger on the spawned thread, giving faster Start()
    calls.

    Rewrite ThreadPosix.
    This is the same change as already made for Windows:
    https://webrtc-codereview.appspot.com/37069004/
    
    * Remove "dead" and "alive" variables.
    * Remove critical section
    * Remove implementation of SetNotAlive()
    * Always set thread name
    * Add thread checks for correct usage.
    
    * Changed AudioDeviceMac to create/start/stop/delete thread objects for playout and recording, inside the respective start and stop method.  The reason for this is because the AudioDeviceMac instance is currently being created on one thread and the above Start/Stop methods are being called on a different thread.  So, my change makes creation, start/stop, deletion of the thread objects always happen on the same thread.
    
    I'm making CurrentThreadId() in rtc_base_approved more visible so that it can be used  from there instead of inside webrtc. Down the line we will have more thread concepts in rtc_base_approved, so I put a TODO for myself to move this functionality to there once we do.

    Fix OSX keydown detection. I noticed that the OSX implementation differs from Linux and Windows, and it will trigger continuously for a key that is pressed down. It would totally make sense to change this to a callback driven model, but that's a bigger change.

    Moving the pacer and the pacer thread to ChannelGroup.
    
    This means all channels within the same group will share the same pacing queue and scheduler. It also means padding will be computed and sent by a single pacer. To accomplish this I also introduce a PacketRouter which finds the RTP module which owns the packet to be paced out.

    Reorganize test targets in WebRTC
    
    This CL will lower the number of test targets in WebRTC by:
    
    Add common_audio_unittests and merge the following targets into it (copied from http://review.webrtc.org/1584006):
    * resampler_unittests
    * signal_processing_unittests
    * vad_unittests

    * bitrate_controller_unittests
    * desktop_capture_unittests
    * media_file_unittests
    * remote_bitrate_estimator_unittests
    * rtp_rtcp_unittests
    * paced_sender_unittests
    
    Merge into test_support_unittests:
    * channel_transport_unittests
    
    channel_transport.gyp was also removed in favor for test.gyp.
    
    I had to remove a main method from rtcp_format_remb_unittest.cc
    since it caused the fileutils.h code to not be able to find the
    right project root path in ordrer to provide correct paths
    to test files.

    Add RTC_ prefix to (D)CHECKs and related macros.
    
    We must remove dependency on Chromium, i.e. we can't use Chromium's base/logging.h. That means we need to define these macros in WebRTC also when doing Chromium builds. And this causes redefinition.
    
    Alternative solutions:
    * Check if we already have defined e.g. CHECK, and don't define them in that case. This makes us depend on include order in Chromium, which is not acceptable.
    * Don't allow using the macros in WebRTC headers. Error prone since if someone adds it there by mistake it may compile fine, but later break if a header in added or order is changed in Chromium. That will be confusing and hard to enforce.
    * Ensure that headers that are included by an embedder don't include our macros. This would require some heavy refactoring to be maintainable and enforcable.
    * Changes in Chromium for this is obviously not an option.

    Moving the pacer and the pacer thread to ChannelGroup.
    
    This means all channels within the same group will share the same pacing queue and scheduler. It also means padding will be computed and sent by a single pacer. To accomplish this I also introduce a PacketRouter which finds the RTP module which owns the packet to be paced out.

    Enable probing with repeated payload packets by default.
    
    To make this possible padding only packets will have the same timestamp
    as the previously sent media packet, as long as RTX is not enabled. This
    has the side effect that if we send only padding for a long time without
    sending media, a receive-side jitter buffer could potentially overflow.
    
    In practice this shouldn't be an issue, partly because RTX is recommended and
    used by default, but also because padding typically is terminated before being
    received by a client. It is also not an issue for bandwidth estimation as long
    as abs-send-time is used instead of toffset.

    Use int64_t for milliseconds more often, primarily for TimeUntilNextProcess.
    
    This fixes a variety of MSVC warnings about value truncations when implicitly
    storing the 64-bit values we get back from e.g. TimeTicks in 32-bit objects, and
    removes the need for a number of explicit casts.
    
    This also moves a number of constants so they're declared right where they're used, which is easier to read and maintain, and makes some of them of integral type rather than using the "enum hack".

    Reworked paced sender queue
    
    Packet queue in the paced sender is now based on a priority queue rather than having a separate fifo-queue per priority level. This allows more flexible sorting and cleaner usage.
    
    Packets with earlier capture times are now prioritized higher. In situations with high packet loss, the queue might contain packets from several subsequent frames. Retransmit packets from the earlier frames first, since the later ones will probably be dependent on these.
    
    Also, don't force sending of packets after a certain time of inactivity or when packets grow too old, since this was causing consistent overuse on poor connections. Instead, drop frames in vie encoder if pacer queue is too long.

    Improvements to the pacer where it lost some budget due to truncation errors.
    
    With this CL the resolution is increased to microseconds and proper rounding
    is done in the Process() function. This means that we will be allowed to send
    more than prior to r6664 as we previously truncated away parts of our budget.
    
    We will also not lose budget due to inaccurate calculations in
    TimeUntilNextProcess(), which was a regression in r6664.

    Simplify pacer interface.
    
    New interface uses two bitrates (max/min). The pace multiplier is also
    removed from the interface and instead utilized outside. Min bitrate
    will be filled with padding if there's not enough media to transmit.
    
    Also fixes a bug in minimum transmission bitrate that made it ignore
    REMBs. A regression test has been added to catch it.

    Add interface to signal a network down event.
    
    - In real-time mode encoding will be paused until the network is back up.
    - In buffering mode the encoder will keep encoding, and packets will be
      buffered at the sender. When the buffer grows above the target delay
      encoding will be paused.
    - Fixes a couple of issues related to pacing which was found with the new test.
    - Introduces different max bitrates for pacing and for encoding. This allows
      the pacer to faster get rid of the queue after a network down event.

      buffered at the sender. When the buffer grows above the target delay
      encoding will be paused.
    - Fixes a couple of issues related to pacing which was found with the new test.
    - Introduces different max bitrates for pacing and for encoding. This allows
      the pacer to faster get rid of the queue after a network down event.

    Enable probing with repeated payload packets by default.
    
    To make this possible padding only packets will have the same timestamp
    as the previously sent media packet, as long as RTX is not enabled. This
    has the side effect that if we send only padding for a long time without
    sending media, a receive-side jitter buffer could potentially overflow.
    
    In practice this shouldn't be an issue, partly because RTX is recommended and
    used by default, but also because padding typically is terminated before being
    received by a client. It is also not an issue for bandwidth estimation as long
    as abs-send-time is used instead of toffset.

    Reworked paced sender queue
    
    Packet queue in the paced sender is now based on a priority queue rather than having a separate fifo-queue per priority level. This allows more flexible sorting and cleaner usage.
    
    Packets with earlier capture times are now prioritized higher. In situations with high packet loss, the queue might contain packets from several subsequent frames. Retransmit packets from the earlier frames first, since the later ones will probably be dependent on these.
    
    Also, don't force sending of packets after a certain time of inactivity or when packets grow too old, since this was causing consistent overuse on poor connections. Instead, drop frames in vie encoder if pacer queue is too long.

    Simplify pacer interface.
    
    New interface uses two bitrates (max/min). The pace multiplier is also
    removed from the interface and instead utilized outside. Min bitrate
    will be filled with padding if there's not enough media to transmit.
    
    Also fixes a bug in minimum transmission bitrate that made it ignore
    REMBs. A regression test has been added to catch it.

    - A bug was introduced in r4234 causing no paced packets to be sent.
    - Only update the sequence number counter if a padding packet is actually going to be sent, to avoid packet loss.
    - Have all packets go through the pacer if pacing is enabled to avoid reordering.
    - Fix race condition on reading capture_time_ms_/timestamp_ in rtp_sender.cc.

    - In real-time mode encoding will be paused until the network is back up.
    - In buffering mode the encoder will keep encoding, and packets will be
      buffered at the sender. When the buffer grows above the target delay
      encoding will be paused.
    - Fixes a couple of issues related to pacing which was found with the new test.
    - Introduces different max bitrates for pacing and for encoding. This allows
      the pacer to faster get rid of the queue after a network down event.

    This means all channels within the same group will share the same pacing queue and scheduler. It also means padding will be computed and sent by a single pacer. To accomplish this I also introduce a PacketRouter which finds the RTP module which owns the packet to be paced out.

    GN: Disable Chromium clang plugins for standalone build.
    
    Now that WebRTC has rolled the chromium_revision past
    http://crrev.com/284372 in r6784, clang has become the
    default compiler. Since WebRTC standalone code doesn't
    yet compile the Chromium Clang plugins enabled, this CL
    disables them for the parts of the code that doesn't yet pass
    compilation with them enabled.
    
    The buildbots are using Goma which is not yet switched
    over to Clang by default. That's why they're not red yet.

    Enable probing with repeated payload packets by default.
    
    To make this possible padding only packets will have the same timestamp
    as the previously sent media packet, as long as RTX is not enabled. This
    has the side effect that if we send only padding for a long time without
    sending media, a receive-side jitter buffer could potentially overflow.
    
    In practice this shouldn't be an issue, partly because RTX is recommended and
    used by default, but also because padding typically is terminated before being
    received by a client. It is also not an issue for bandwidth estimation as long
    as abs-send-time is used instead of toffset.

    Roll chromium_revision e144d30..6fdb142 (318658:318841) + remove OVERRIDE macro
    
    Clang version changed 223108:230914
    Details: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/e144d30..6fdb142/tools/clang/scripts/update.sh
    
    Removes the OVERRIDE macro defined in:
    * webrtc/base/common.h
    * webrtc/typedefs.h
    
    The majority of the source changes were done by running this in src/:
    perl -0pi -e "s/virtual\s([^({;]*(\([^({;]*\)[^({;]*))(OVERRIDE|override)/\1override/sg" `find {talk,webrtc} -name "*.h"  -o -name "*.cc*" -o -name "*.mm*"`
    
    which converted all:
    virtual Foo() OVERRIDE
    functions to:
    Foo() override
    
    Then I manually edited:
    * talk/media/webrtc/fakewebrtccommon.h
    * webrtc/test/fake_common.h
    
    Remaining uses of OVERRIDE was fixed by search+replace.
    
    Manual edits were done to fix virtual destructors that were
    overriding inherited ones.
    
    Finally a build error related to the pure virtual definitions of
    Read, Write and Rewind in common_types.h required a bit of
    refactoring in:
    * webrtc/common_types.cc
    * webrtc/common_types.h
    * webrtc/system_wrappers/interface/file_wrapper.h
    * webrtc/system_wrappers/source/file_impl.cc
    
    This roll should make it possible for us to finally re-enable deadlock
    detection for TSan on the buildbots.

    Use int64_t for milliseconds more often, primarily for TimeUntilNextProcess.
    
    This fixes a variety of MSVC warnings about value truncations when implicitly
    storing the 64-bit values we get back from e.g. TimeTicks in 32-bit objects, and
    removes the need for a number of explicit casts.
    
    This also moves a number of constants so they're declared right where they're used, which is easier to read and maintain, and makes some of them of integral type rather than using the "enum hack".

    Reworked paced sender queue
    
    Packet queue in the paced sender is now based on a priority queue rather than having a separate fifo-queue per priority level. This allows more flexible sorting and cleaner usage.
    
    Packets with earlier capture times are now prioritized higher. In situations with high packet loss, the queue might contain packets from several subsequent frames. Retransmit packets from the earlier frames first, since the later ones will probably be dependent on these.
    
    Also, don't force sending of packets after a certain time of inactivity or when packets grow too old, since this was causing consistent overuse on poor connections. Instead, drop frames in vie encoder if pacer queue is too long.

    Improvements to the pacer where it lost some budget due to truncation errors.
    
    With this CL the resolution is increased to microseconds and proper rounding
    is done in the Process() function. This means that we will be allowed to send
    more than prior to r6664 as we previously truncated away parts of our budget.
    
    We will also not lose budget due to inaccurate calculations in
    TimeUntilNextProcess(), which was a regression in r6664.

    Move pacer to fully use webrtc::Clock instead of webrtc::TickTime.
    
    This required rewriting the send-side delay stats api to be callback based, as otherwise the SuspendBelowMinBitrate test started flaking much more frequently since it had lock order inversion problems.

    Simplify pacer interface.
    
    New interface uses two bitrates (max/min). The pace multiplier is also
    removed from the interface and instead utilized outside. Min bitrate
    will be filled with padding if there's not enough media to transmit.
    
    Also fixes a bug in minimum transmission bitrate that made it ignore
    REMBs. A regression test has been added to catch it.

      buffered at the sender. When the buffer grows above the target delay
      encoding will be paused.
    - Fixes a couple of issues related to pacing which was found with the new test.

    Add support for transport wide sequence numbers
    
    Also refactor packet router to use a map rather than iterate over all
    rtp modules for each packet sent.

    Moving the pacer and the pacer thread to ChannelGroup.
    
    This means all channels within the same group will share the same pacing queue and scheduler. It also means padding will be computed and sent by a single pacer. To accomplish this I also introduce a PacketRouter which finds the RTP module which owns the packet to be paced out.

    Use int64_t for milliseconds more often, primarily for TimeUntilNextProcess.
    
    This fixes a variety of MSVC warnings about value truncations when implicitly
    storing the 64-bit values we get back from e.g. TimeTicks in 32-bit objects, and
    removes the need for a number of explicit casts.
    
    This also moves a number of constants so they're declared right where they're used, which is easier to read and maintain, and makes some of them of integral type rather than using the "enum hack".

    This required updating our Android projects to API level 22,
    as third_party/android_tools dropped support for API level 21.
    
    Command used:
    perl -pi -e "s/android-21/android-22/g" `find . -name project.properties`
    Using 'android update project' would also work but that changes the
    ANDROID_SDK_ROOT -> ANDROID_HOME, which the Chromium build toolchain
    doesn't set properly when build/android/envsetup.sh is sourced.
    
    Clang version was not updated in this roll.

    * src/third_party/android_tools: fd5a8ec..98a4345
    Details: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/00e438c..8d51d96/DEPS
    
    This required updating our Android projects to API level 22,
    as third_party/android_tools dropped support for API level 21.
    
    Command used:
    perl -pi -e "s/android-21/android-22/g" `find . -name project.properties`
    Using 'android update project' would also work but that changes the
    ANDROID_SDK_ROOT -> ANDROID_HOME, which the Chromium build toolchain
    doesn't set properly when build/android/envsetup.sh is sourced.
    
    Clang version was not updated in this roll.

    WebRTCDemo: remove unnecessary stop & start during orientation change which isn't necessary since API v14.
    (required bumping minSdkVersion to 14)
    
    This fixes a RuntimeException thrown on GalaxyNexus (but not N7, N4, or NS)
    during startPreview() after the sequence of Start(), Stop(), Start(); seemingly
    GN's OMX stack can't deal with parallel startPreview() & setPreviewDisplay() in
    this situation.
    
    Also:
    - Only set the surface in the camera when valid
    - Remove duplicate assignment
    - Fix error check on voiceChannel allocation to account for multiple channel creation due to orientation change causing onDestroy()/onCreate() on the app, and rampant use of process-static holders for VoE data.

    Refactoring WebRTC Java/JNI audio track in C++ and Java.
    
    This CL is part II in a major refactoring effort. See https://webrtc-codereview.appspot.com/33969004 for part I.
    
    - Removes unused code and old WEBRTC logging macros
    - Now uses optimal sample rate and buffer size in Java AudioTrack (used hard-coded sample rate before)
    - Makes code more inline with the implementation in Chrome
    - Adds helper methods for JNI handling to improve readability
    - Changes the threading model (high-prio audio thread now lives in Java-land and C++ only works as proxy)
    - Simplified the delay estimate
    - Adds basic thread checks
    - Removes all locks in C++ land
    - Removes all locks in Java
    - Improves construction/destruction
    - Additional cleanup
    
    Tested using AppRTCDemo and WebRTCDemo APKs on N6, N5, N7, Samsung Galaxy S4 and
    Samsung Galaxy S4 mini (which uses 44.1kHz as native sample rate).

    Adds C++/JNI/Java unit test for audio device module on Android.
    
    This CL adds support for unittests of the AudioDeviceModule on Android using both Java and C++. The new framework uses ::testing::TesWithParam to support both Java-based audio and OpenSL ES based audio. However, given existing issues in our OpenSL ES implementation, the list of test parameters only contains Java in this first version. Open SL ES will be enabled as soon as the backend has been refactored.
    
    It also:
    
    - Removes the redundant JNIEnv* argument in webrtc::VoiceEngine::SetAndroidObjects().
    - Modifies usage of enable_android_opensl and the WEBRTC_ANDROID_OPENSLES define.
    - Adds kAndroidJavaAudio and kAndroidOpenSLESAudio to AudioLayer enumerator.
    - Fixes some bugs which were discovered when running the tests.

    1. Project win_test had some calls to the removed methods, but it turned out that the project is not used anymore, so I removed it entirely.
    2. There were some calls to removed methods in jni methods. I have removed couple of jni methods as now they seem to do nothing.
    3. With the remaining callers I just removed the calls to removed methods.

    Refactoring WebRTC Java/JNI audio recording in C++ and Java.
    
    This is a big refactoring of the existing C++/JNI/Java support for audio recording in native WebRTC:
    
    - Removes unused code and old WEBRTC logging macros
    - Now uses optimal sample rate and buffer size in Java AudioRecord (used hard-coded sample rate before)
    - Makes code more inline with the implementation in Chrome
    - Adds helper methods for JNI handling to improve readability
    - Changes the threading model (high-prio audio thread now lives in Java-land and C++ only works as proxy)
    - Adds basic thread checks
    - Removes all locks in C++ land
    - Removes all locks in Java
    - Improves construction/destruction
    - Additional cleanup
    
    Tested using AppRTCDemo and WebRTCDemo APKs on N6, N5, N7, Samsung Galaxy S4 and
    Samsung Galaxy S4 mini (which uses 44.1kHz as native sample rate).

    Refactoring WebRTC Java/JNI audio recording in C++ and Java.
    
    This is a big refactoring of the existing C++/JNI/Java support for audio recording in native WebRTC:
    
    - Removes unused code and old WEBRTC logging macros
    - Now uses optimal sample rate and buffer size in Java AudioRecord (used hard-coded sample rate before)
    - Makes code more inline with the implementation in Chrome
    - Adds helper methods for JNI handling to improve readability
    - Changes the threading model (high-prio audio thread now lives in Java-land and C++ only works as proxy)
    - Adds basic thread checks
    - Removes all locks in C++ land
    - Removes all locks in Java
    - Improves construction/destruction
    - Additional cleanup
    
    Tested using AppRTCDemo and WebRTCDemo APKs on N6, N5, N7, Samsung Galaxy S4 and
    Samsung Galaxy S4 mini (which uses 44.1kHz as native sample rate).

    Move all the examples from the talk directory into the webrtc examples directory.
    
    Significant changes:
    
    - move the libjingle_examples.gyp file into webrtc directory.
    - rename talk/examples/android to webrtc/examples/androidapp to avoid name conflicts.
    - update paths in talk/libjingle_tests.gyp to point to webrtc directory for Objective-C test.

    Update Android projects to API level 20.
    
    This is required in order to roll chromium_revision to
    keep up with Chrome, as third_party/android_tools have now
    dropped support for API level 19.
    
    Commands used:
    third_party/android_tools/sdk/tools/android update project --name OpenSlDemo --target android-20 --path webrtc/examples/android/opensl_loopback
    third_party/android_tools/sdk/tools/android update project --name WebRTCDemo --target android-20 --path webrtc/examples/android/media_demo/
    third_party/android_tools/sdk/tools/android update project --name AppRTCDemo --target android-20 --path talk/examples/android/
    Then I restored the changes of the ANDROID_SDK_ROOT -> ANDROID_HOME since it seems the Chromium build toolchain doesn't set it properly when
    build/android/envsetup.sh is sourced.

    Android AppRTCDemo: Add slider for changing camera capture quality during call
    
    This CL adds a slider that can change capture resolution and fps during a call. The camera will no be reconfigured, but the frames will be downscaled/dropped in software by cricket::VideoAdapter in the cricket::VideoCapturer. This is controlled with VideoCapturerAndroid.onOutputFormatRequest(). The slider is turned off by default and can be enabled with a checkbox under 'WebRTC Video Settings'.

    Android AppRTCDemo: Add slider for changing camera capture quality during call
    
    This CL adds a slider that can change capture resolution and fps during a call. The camera will no be reconfigured, but the frames will be downscaled/dropped in software by cricket::VideoAdapter in the cricket::VideoCapturer. This is controlled with VideoCapturerAndroid.onOutputFormatRequest(). The slider is turned off by default and can be enabled with a checkbox under 'WebRTC Video Settings'.

    Android AppRTCDemo: Add slider for changing camera capture quality during call
    
    This CL adds a slider that can change capture resolution and fps during a call. The camera will no be reconfigured, but the frames will be downscaled/dropped in software by cricket::VideoAdapter in the cricket::VideoCapturer. This is controlled with VideoCapturerAndroid.onOutputFormatRequest(). The slider is turned off by default and can be enabled with a checkbox under 'WebRTC Video Settings'.

    Android AppRTCDemo: Add slider for changing camera capture quality during call
    
    This CL adds a slider that can change capture resolution and fps during a call. The camera will no be reconfigured, but the frames will be downscaled/dropped in software by cricket::VideoAdapter in the cricket::VideoCapturer. This is controlled with VideoCapturerAndroid.onOutputFormatRequest(). The slider is turned off by default and can be enabled with a checkbox under 'WebRTC Video Settings'.

    Android AppRTCDemo: Add slider for changing camera capture quality during call
    
    This CL adds a slider that can change capture resolution and fps during a call. The camera will no be reconfigured, but the frames will be downscaled/dropped in software by cricket::VideoAdapter in the cricket::VideoCapturer. This is controlled with VideoCapturerAndroid.onOutputFormatRequest(). The slider is turned off by default and can be enabled with a checkbox under 'WebRTC Video Settings'.

    Revert of AppRTCDemo: Render each video in a separate SurfaceView (patchset #4 id:120001 of https://codereview.webrtc.org/1257043004/ )
    
    Reason for revert:
    AppRTCDemo often crashes in loopback mode and incorrect layout when connection is established

    Android AppRTCDemo: Add slider for changing camera capture quality during call
    
    This CL adds a slider that can change capture resolution and fps during a call. The camera will no be reconfigured, but the frames will be downscaled/dropped in software by cricket::VideoAdapter in the cricket::VideoCapturer. This is controlled with VideoCapturerAndroid.onOutputFormatRequest(). The slider is turned off by default and can be enabled with a checkbox under 'WebRTC Video Settings'.

    - Make shared EGL context used for HW video decoding member
    of decoder factory class.
    - Add new Peer connection factory method to initialize shared

    This provides an option to use single peer connection factory
    in the application and create peer connections from the same
    factory and reinitialize shared EGL context for video
    decoding HW acceleration.

    Using 'android update project' would also work but that changes the

    doesn't set properly when build/android/envsetup.sh is sourced.

    Update Android projects to API level 20.
    
    This is required in order to roll chromium_revision to
    keep up with Chrome, as third_party/android_tools have now
    dropped support for API level 19.
    
    Commands used:
    third_party/android_tools/sdk/tools/android update project --name OpenSlDemo --target android-20 --path webrtc/examples/android/opensl_loopback
    third_party/android_tools/sdk/tools/android update project --name WebRTCDemo --target android-20 --path webrtc/examples/android/media_demo/
    third_party/android_tools/sdk/tools/android update project --name AppRTCDemo --target android-20 --path talk/examples/android/
    Then I restored the changes of the ANDROID_SDK_ROOT -> ANDROID_HOME since it seems the Chromium build toolchain doesn't set it properly when
    build/android/envsetup.sh is sourced.

    Java VideoRenderer.Callbacks: Make renderFrame() interface asynchronous
    
    This CL makes the Java render interface asynchronous by requiring every call to renderFrame() to be followed by an explicit renderFrameDone() call. In JNI, this is implemented with cricket::VideoFrame::Copy() before calling renderFrame(), and a corresponding call to delete in renderFrameDone(). This CL is primarily done to prepare for a new renderer implementation.

    Fix clang style warnings in webrtc/base
    
    Mostly this consists of marking functions with override when
    applicable, and moving function bodies from .h to .cc files.
    
    Not inlining virtual functions with simple bodies such as
    
      { return false; }
    
    strikes me as probably losing more in readability than we gain in
    binary size and compilation time, but I guess it's just like any other
    case where enabling a generally good warning forces us to write
    slightly worse code in a couple of places.

    Move all the examples from the talk directory into the webrtc examples directory.
    
    Significant changes:
    
    - move the libjingle_examples.gyp file into webrtc directory.
    - rename talk/examples/android to webrtc/examples/androidapp to avoid name conflicts.
    - update paths in talk/libjingle_tests.gyp to point to webrtc directory for Objective-C test.

    Fix clang style warnings in webrtc/base
    
    Mostly this consists of marking functions with override when
    applicable, and moving function bodies from .h to .cc files.
    
    Not inlining virtual functions with simple bodies such as
    
      { return false; }
    
    strikes me as probably losing more in readability than we gain in
    binary size and compilation time, but I guess it's just like any other
    case where enabling a generally good warning forces us to write
    slightly worse code in a couple of places.

    Fix clang style warnings in webrtc/base
    
    Mostly this consists of marking functions with override when
    applicable, and moving function bodies from .h to .cc files.
    
    Not inlining virtual functions with simple bodies such as
    
      { return false; }
    
    strikes me as probably losing more in readability than we gain in
    binary size and compilation time, but I guess it's just like any other
    case where enabling a generally good warning forces us to write
    slightly worse code in a couple of places.

    Fix clang style warnings in webrtc/base
    
    Mostly this consists of marking functions with override when
    applicable, and moving function bodies from .h to .cc files.
    
    Not inlining virtual functions with simple bodies such as
    
      { return false; }
    
    strikes me as probably losing more in readability than we gain in
    binary size and compilation time, but I guess it's just like any other
    case where enabling a generally good warning forces us to write
    slightly worse code in a couple of places.

    Fix style violations in common_types.h and config.h
    
    Mostly, it's about moving constructors and descructors to the .cc
    files, so that they won't be inlined everywhere.
    
    The reason this CL is so big is that a lot of code was using
    common_types.h without declaring a dependency on webrtc_common, which
    broke the build once common_types.h started to depend on

    GYP variables for building expat, icu, libsrtp, usrsctp
    
    This makes the build more flexible when linking against
    prebuilt external libraries.
    
    Use existing build_* variables for libyuv and json in talk/
    (already in use in webrtc/).
    
    Also make it possible to avoid building the GTK parts of the Linux build.

    Add RTC_ prefix to contructormagic macros.
    
    We must remove dependency on Chromium, i.e. we can't use Chromium's base/logging.h. That means we need to define these macros in WebRTC also when doing Chromium builds. And this causes redefinition.

    Add RTC_ prefix to contructormagic macros.
    
    We must remove dependency on Chromium, i.e. we can't use Chromium's base/logging.h. That means we need to define these macros in WebRTC also when doing Chromium builds. And this causes redefinition.
    
    * DISALLOW_ASSIGN -> RTC_DISALLOW_ASSIGN
    * DISALLOW_COPY_AND_ASSIGN -> RTC_DISALLOW_COPY_AND_ASSIGN
    * DISALLOW_IMPLICIT_CONSTRUCTORS -> RTC_DISALLOW_IMPLICIT_CONSTRUCTORS

    Cleanup: Remove DISALLOW_EVIL_CONSTRUCTORS macro.
    
    Just use the less-evil version, DISALLOW_COPY_AND_ASSIGN macro.
    
    This should help with my TODO in

    GYP variables for building expat, icu, libsrtp, usrsctp
    
    This makes the build more flexible when linking against
    prebuilt external libraries.
    
    Use existing build_* variables for libyuv and json in talk/
    (already in use in webrtc/).
    
    Also make it possible to avoid building the GTK parts of the Linux build.

    Partial revert of r7014 (Android APK refactor)
    
    This reverts selected parts of r7014 to enable
    rolling WebRTC in Chromium DEPS.
    
    This works around the problem with GYP includes
    being processed in the first pass (i.e. variables
    cannot be used for paths). Using a dependency with
    a path using a variable that is conditioned for
    build_with_chromium being 0 or 1 solves the Chromium
    build.
    
    These changes will be restored once I've finished
    a major GYP refactoring that will break out all
    test related code (at least the parts that includes

    Partial revert of r7014 (Android APK refactor)
    
    This reverts selected parts of r7014 to enable
    rolling WebRTC in Chromium DEPS.
    
    This works around the problem with GYP includes
    being processed in the first pass (i.e. variables
    cannot be used for paths). Using a dependency with
    a path using a variable that is conditioned for
    build_with_chromium being 0 or 1 solves the Chromium
    build.
    
    These changes will be restored once I've finished
    a major GYP refactoring that will break out all
    test related code (at least the parts that includes
    the Android APK targets) into a separate chain
    of GYP targets that are not processed when generating
    projects for Chromium (which is why r7014 is breaking

    Android APK tests built from a normal WebRTC checkout.
    
    Restructure how the Android APK tests are compiled now
    that we have a Chromium checkout available (since r6938).
    
    This removes the need of several hacks that were needed when
    building these targets from inside a Chromium checkout.
    By creating a symlink to Chromium's base we can compile the required
    targets. This also removes the need of the previously precompiled
    binaries we keep in /deps/tools/android at Google code.
    
    All the user needs to do is to add the target_os = ["android"]
    entry to his .gclient as described at
    https://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/AndroidBuildInstructions
    
    Before committing this CL, the Android APK buildbots will need
    to be updated.
    This also solves http://crbug.com/402594 since the apply_svn_patch.py
    usage will be similar to the other standalone bots.

    Isolate GYP target and .isolate files for tests
    
    This is a re-land attempt of http://review.webrtc.org/1673004/
    It now includes a build/isolate.gypi in WebRTC that includes the same
    file as the one that would be included when WebRTC is used in a Chromium
    checkout. It is needed since it is not possible to use variables in GYP's
    includes sections.
    
    Implemented according to the instructions at
    http://www.chromium.org/developers/testing/isolated-testing
    
    Workflow has been like this:
    1. create _run GYP target
    2. create a stripped down .isolate file
    3. export GYP_DEFINES="$GYP_DEFINES test_isolation_mode=check"
    4. runhooks
    5. compile
    6. test if the test would run (i.e. find it's dependencies) without
       actually executing it:
       tools/swarm_client/isolate.py run --isolated out/Release/testname.isolated
    7. If failing, run the fix_test_cases.py script like this:
       tools/swarm_client/googletest/fix_test_cases.py --isolated out/Release/testname.isolated
    
    All tests that run on the bots for WebRTC has got _run target
    and .isolate file created.
    
    "Normal tests" that run fine on any machine:
    * audio_decoder_unittests
    * common_audio_unittests
    * common_video_unittests
    * metrics_unittests
    * modules_tests

    Tests that requires bare-metal and audio/video devices:

    * video_capture_tests
    
    I also added the isolate boilerplate code for the following

    * vie_auto_test

    * metrics_unittests
    * modules_tests

    * test_support_unittests

    Tests that requires bare-metal and audio/video devices:
    * audio_device_tests
    * video_capture_tests
    
    I also added the isolate boilerplate code for the following
    tests that are not yet pure gtest binaries (which means they
    cannot run isolated yet):
    * video_render_tests
    * vie_auto_test
    * voe_auto_test
    
    TEST=running isolate.py as described above. WebRTC trybots passing. Created a Chromium checkout with third_party/webrtc ToT and this patch applied, passing the runhooks step.

    Add RTC_ prefix to contructormagic macros.
    
    We must remove dependency on Chromium, i.e. we can't use Chromium's base/logging.h. That means we need to define these macros in WebRTC also when doing Chromium builds. And this causes redefinition.

    Roll chromium_revision e144d30..6fdb142 (318658:318841) + remove OVERRIDE macro
    
    Clang version changed 223108:230914
    Details: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/e144d30..6fdb142/tools/clang/scripts/update.sh
    
    Removes the OVERRIDE macro defined in:
    * webrtc/base/common.h
    * webrtc/typedefs.h
    
    The majority of the source changes were done by running this in src/:
    perl -0pi -e "s/virtual\s([^({;]*(\([^({;]*\)[^({;]*))(OVERRIDE|override)/\1override/sg" `find {talk,webrtc} -name "*.h"  -o -name "*.cc*" -o -name "*.mm*"`
    
    which converted all:
    virtual Foo() OVERRIDE
    functions to:
    Foo() override
    
    Then I manually edited:
    * talk/media/webrtc/fakewebrtccommon.h
    * webrtc/test/fake_common.h
    
    Remaining uses of OVERRIDE was fixed by search+replace.
    
    Manual edits were done to fix virtual destructors that were
    overriding inherited ones.
    
    Finally a build error related to the pure virtual definitions of
    Read, Write and Rewind in common_types.h required a bit of
    refactoring in:
    * webrtc/common_types.cc
    * webrtc/common_types.h
    * webrtc/system_wrappers/interface/file_wrapper.h
    * webrtc/system_wrappers/source/file_impl.cc
    
    This roll should make it possible for us to finally re-enable deadlock
    detection for TSan on the buildbots.

    To catch regressions, I've started using the ThreadChecker class on the processing thread but it might also be a good idea to add similar checks for other known threads such as the thread we receive frames on.  I'm sure we can reduce locking even further.

    Adding constness.
    
    Make a few member variables in the Transport class officially const so that it's clear that locking isn't needed for access. There are getters for some of these (e.g. content_name()) that don't have locking or checking, so making the variables const is at least a way to guard against regressions. Also making the clock_ member in overuse_frame_detector.h const for clarity that it doesn't require a lock for access.
    
    No code change.

    Use int64_t for milliseconds more often, primarily for TimeUntilNextProcess.
    
    This fixes a variety of MSVC warnings about value truncations when implicitly
    storing the 64-bit values we get back from e.g. TimeTicks in 32-bit objects, and
    removes the need for a number of explicit casts.
    
    This also moves a number of constants so they're declared right where they're used, which is easier to read and maintain, and makes some of them of integral type rather than using the "enum hack".

    Raw packet loss rate reported by RTP_RTCP module may vary too drastically over time. This CL is to add a filter to the value in VoE before lending it to audio coding module.
    
    The filter is an exponential filter borrowed from video coding module.
    
    The method is written in a new class called PacketLossProtector (not sure if the name is nice), which can be used in the future for more sophisticated logic.

    Overuse detection based on capture-input jitter.
    
    This is believed to be more reliable in real-world cases. The camera seems to fall behind sooner than the encoder starts taking too long time encoding, so this is believed to be an earlier trigger.

    This is believed to be more reliable in real-world cases. The camera seems to fall behind sooner than the encoder starts taking too long time encoding, so this is believed to be an earlier trigger.

    Remove channel ids from various interfaces.
    
    Starts by removing channel/engine id from ViEChannel which propagates
    down to the RTP/RTCP module as well as the transport class.
    
    IncomingVideoStream::RenderFrame() is untouched for now but receives a
    fake id instead of the previous channel id. Added a TODO to remove it
    later but the RenderFrame call is implemented in a lot of
    platform-dependent files and should probably remove the "manager" aspect
    of renderers, so preferring to do it separately

    Theis data needs to be translated into a format which the bandwidth

    Rename I420VideoFrame to VideoFrame.
    
    This is a mechanical change since it affects so many
    files.
    I420VideoFrame -> VideoFrame
    and reformatted.
    
    Rationale: in the next CL I420VideoFrame will
    get an indication of Pixel Format (I420 for
    starters) and of storage type: usually
    UNOWNED, could be SHMEM, and in the near
    future will be possibly TEXTURE. See

    Moving the pacer and the pacer thread to ChannelGroup.
    
    This means all channels within the same group will share the same pacing queue and scheduler. It also means padding will be computed and sent by a single pacer. To accomplish this I also introduce a PacketRouter which finds the RTP module which owns the packet to be paced out.

    Add CVO support to Vie layer.
    
    1. standard plumbing CVO through vie layer.
    2. added a rtp_cvo.h which has both conversion functions from rtp header byte to/from VideoRotation.
    
    WebRTCVideoEngine will later pass the rotation info in SendFrame() through VieVideoFrameI420.

    Roll chromium_revision e144d30..6fdb142 (318658:318841) + remove OVERRIDE macro
    
    Clang version changed 223108:230914
    Details: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/e144d30..6fdb142/tools/clang/scripts/update.sh
    
    Removes the OVERRIDE macro defined in:
    * webrtc/base/common.h
    * webrtc/typedefs.h
    
    The majority of the source changes were done by running this in src/:
    perl -0pi -e "s/virtual\s([^({;]*(\([^({;]*\)[^({;]*))(OVERRIDE|override)/\1override/sg" `find {talk,webrtc} -name "*.h"  -o -name "*.cc*" -o -name "*.mm*"`
    
    which converted all:
    virtual Foo() OVERRIDE
    functions to:
    Foo() override
    
    Then I manually edited:
    * talk/media/webrtc/fakewebrtccommon.h
    * webrtc/test/fake_common.h
    
    Remaining uses of OVERRIDE was fixed by search+replace.
    
    Manual edits were done to fix virtual destructors that were
    overriding inherited ones.
    
    Finally a build error related to the pure virtual definitions of
    Read, Write and Rewind in common_types.h required a bit of
    refactoring in:
    * webrtc/common_types.cc
    * webrtc/common_types.h
    * webrtc/system_wrappers/interface/file_wrapper.h
    * webrtc/system_wrappers/source/file_impl.cc
    
    This roll should make it possible for us to finally re-enable deadlock
    detection for TSan on the buildbots.

    Fix shutdown race for ViEEncoder when there is a frame in the encoder.
    
    There is a potential race when deleting a channel and there is a frame
    in the encoder. ViEEncoder::SendData can be called after
    ViEEncoder::StopThreadsAndRemovePayloadRouter and payload_router is
    then already removed.
    
    Until we have the new API in place, use scoped_refptr in ViEChannel and
    ViEEncoder and deregister channel/encoder before deleting.

    Existing code was inconsistent about whether to use uint16_t, int, unsigned int,

    Support associated payload type when registering Rtx payload type.
    
    Major changes include,
    - Add associated payload type for SetRtxSendPayloadType & SetRtxReceivePayloadType.
    - Receiver: Restore RTP packets by the new RTX-APT map.
    - Sender: Send RTP packets by checking RTX-APT map.
    - Add RTX payload type for RED in the default codec list.

    Return an aggregated report from ViERtpRtcp::GetSentRTCPStatistics().
    
    Fixes issues where statistics only was reported for the first stream if
    configured with simulcast, and in case of RTX the reported statistics was
    depending on the order of the report blocks.
    
    Also fixes issues with multiple report blocks in the SendStatisticsProxy and the
    RtcpStatisticsCallback. SendStatisticsProxy is now aware of RTX ssrcs, and the
    RTCPReceiver is calling the RtcpStatisticsCallback with the correct SSRCs, and
    not only the primary stream SSRC.

    Move pacer to fully use webrtc::Clock instead of webrtc::TickTime.
    
    This required rewriting the send-side delay stats api to be callback based, as otherwise the SuspendBelowMinBitrate test started flaking much more frequently since it had lock order inversion problems.

    Remove the send-side cname getter APIs from voice and video engine.
    
    These APIs aren't being used, and introduces deadlocks when using GetStats() in the new Call api. Having getters for cname at the send-side is pointless, as it's always the user who sets the cname.

    These APIs aren't being used, and introduces deadlocks when using GetStats() in the new Call api. Having getters for cname at the send-side is pointless, as it's always the user who sets the cname.

    Preserve RTP states for restarted VideoSendStreams.
    
    A restarted VideoSendStream would previously be completely reset,
    causing gaps in sequence numbers and potentially RTP timestamps as well.
    This broke SRTP which requires fairly sequential sequence numbers.
    Presumably, were this sent without SRTP, we'd still have problems on the
    receiving end as the corresponding receiver is unaware of this reset.
    
    Also adding annotation to RTPSender and addressing some unlocked
    access to ssrc_, ssrc_rtx_ and rtx_.

    Callback for send bitrate estimates - new roll
    
    Issue https://webrtc-codereview.appspot.com/4459004/ was commited as
    r5259, after which flakiness was detected and a rollback was performed
    at r5261.
    
    Patch Set 1 of this issue is the code submitted in r5259. Subsequent
    patch sets fixes a race condition which caused the seen problems.
    
    The root cause was a dead lock between a thread sending rtp packets and
    and a timed module processing thread:
    
    webrtc::RTPSender::BitrateUpdated()  // Get RTPSender stats lock
    webrtc::Bitrate::Process()  // Get Bitrate lock
    webrtc::RTPSender::ProcessBitrate()
    webrtc::ModuleRtpRtcpImpl::Process()
    ...
    
    webrtc::Bitrate::Update()  // Get Bitrate lock
    webrtc::RTPSender::UpdateRtpStats()  // Get RTPSender stats lock
    webrtc::RTPSender::SendToNetwork()
    ...
    
    This is fixed in Bitrate::Process() by releasing the lock before
    calling the callback.

    and a timed module processing thread:
    
    webrtc::RTPSender::BitrateUpdated()  // Get RTPSender stats lock
    webrtc::Bitrate::Process()  // Get Bitrate lock
    webrtc::RTPSender::ProcessBitrate()
    webrtc::ModuleRtpRtcpImpl::Process()
    ...
    
    webrtc::Bitrate::Update()  // Get Bitrate lock
    webrtc::RTPSender::UpdateRtpStats()  // Get RTPSender stats lock
    webrtc::RTPSender::SendToNetwork()
    ...
    
    This is fixed in Bitrate::Process() by releasing the lock before
    calling the callback.

    Avoid acquiring VCM::_receiveCritSect during decode callback.
    
    When VideoDecoder::Decode, Reset, or Release is called,
    VideoCodingModuleImpl::_receiveCritSect may have been
    acquired. Decode callback needs to acquire the same lock
    in ViEChannel::FrameToRender. It is not a problem for
    SW decode because decode callback is run on the same
    WebRTC decoding thread and the lock is re-entrant. But
    for HW decode, decode callback is run on a thread different
    from WebRTC decoding thread. Decode callback gets the locks
    in the opposite order. Deadlock can happen.
    
    BUG=http://crbug.com/170345
    TEST=Try apprtc.appspot.com/?debug=loopback on ARM Chromebook Daisy.
         Run libjingle_peerconnection_unittest.

    Remove channel ids from various interfaces.
    
    Starts by removing channel/engine id from ViEChannel which propagates
    down to the RTP/RTCP module as well as the transport class.
    
    IncomingVideoStream::RenderFrame() is untouched for now but receives a
    fake id instead of the previous channel id. Added a TODO to remove it
    later but the RenderFrame call is implemented in a lot of
    platform-dependent files and should probably remove the "manager" aspect
    of renderers, so preferring to do it separately

    Add RTC_ prefix to (D)CHECKs and related macros.
    
    We must remove dependency on Chromium, i.e. we can't use Chromium's base/logging.h. That means we need to define these macros in WebRTC also when doing Chromium builds. And this causes redefinition.
    
    Alternative solutions:
    * Check if we already have defined e.g. CHECK, and don't define them in that case. This makes us depend on include order in Chromium, which is not acceptable.
    * Don't allow using the macros in WebRTC headers. Error prone since if someone adds it there by mistake it may compile fine, but later break if a header in added or order is changed in Chromium. That will be confusing and hard to enforce.
    * Ensure that headers that are included by an embedder don't include our macros. This would require some heavy refactoring to be maintainable and enforcable.
    * Changes in Chromium for this is obviously not an option.

    When using send-side bandwidth estimation, the inter-packet delay is
    reported back to the sender using RTCP TransportFeedback messages.
    Theis data needs to be translated into a format which the bandwidth
    estimator (now instantiated on the send side) can use, including looking

    Remove ViEChannel simulcast lock.
    
    Since the number of streams is now known on construction we can
    initialize all RTP modules on construction. They are internally locked
    so we don't nede a simulcast lock anymore.

    Remove VideoEngine interfaces.
    
    Removes ViE interfaces, _impl.cc files, managers (such as
    ViEChannelManager and ViEInputManager) as well as ViESharedData.
    
    Interfaces necessary to implement observers have been moved to a
    corresponding header (such as vie_channel.h).

    Do not register bandwidth observer for receive only channels.
    An incoming rtcp report block is inserted to both send and receive channels in Call::DeliverRtcp. The report block may also be accepted by each receive channel (in addition to the send channel) but fails to calculate the rtt (=0).

    Prevent decoder busy loop for send-only channels.
    
    ViEChannels without default encoders doesn't register a receive codec by
    default. This makes VideoReceiver::Decode return early, causing a
    high-priority thread to effectively be busy looping. This would be
    expected to wreck more havoc in a more cross-platform manner than it has
    visibly done. On Windows XP however it manages to bring the whole
    machine to a grinding halt forcing a reboot if CPU usage hits 100%.

    This CL avoids changing the mentioned callbacks during a call, to avoid
    a potential deadlock when acquiring _sendCritSect and calling

    Moving the critsect revealed a race for the FEC parameters in RtpVideoSender, so the CL grew a bit to avoid this. I also cleaned up some code here at the same time, but tried to keep it at a minimum since this CL had already increased a lot in size.

    Moving the pacer and the pacer thread to ChannelGroup.
    
    This means all channels within the same group will share the same pacing queue and scheduler. It also means padding will be computed and sent by a single pacer. To accomplish this I also introduce a PacketRouter which finds the RTP module which owns the packet to be paced out.

    ProcessThread improvements.
    
    * Added a way to notify a Module that it's been attached to a ProcessThread.
      The benefit of this is to give the module a way to wake up the thread
      when it needs work to happen on the worker thread, immediately.
      Today, module instances are typically registered with a process thread
      outside the control of the modules themselves.  I.e. they typically
      don't know about the process thread they're attached to.
    
    * Improve ProcessThread's WakeUp algorithm to not call TimeUntilNextProcess
      when a WakeUp call is requested.  This is an optimization for the above
      case which avoids the module having to acquire a lock or do an interlocked
      operation before calling WakeUp(), which would ensure the module's
      TimeUntilNextProcess() implementation would return 0.

    Fix shutdown race for ViEEncoder when there is a frame in the encoder.
    
    There is a potential race when deleting a channel and there is a frame
    in the encoder. ViEEncoder::SendData can be called after
    ViEEncoder::StopThreadsAndRemovePayloadRouter and payload_router is
    then already removed.
    
    Until we have the new API in place, use scoped_refptr in ViEChannel and
    ViEEncoder and deregister channel/encoder before deleting.

    Use int64_t more consistently for times, in particular for RTT values.
    
    Existing code was inconsistent about whether to use uint16_t, int, unsigned int,
    or uint32_t, and sometimes silently truncated one to another, or truncated
    int64_t.  Because most core time-handling functions use int64_t, being
    consistent about using int64_t unless otherwise necessary minimizes the number
    of explicit or implicit casts.

    Return an aggregated report from ViERtpRtcp::GetSentRTCPStatistics().
    
    Fixes issues where statistics only was reported for the first stream if
    configured with simulcast, and in case of RTX the reported statistics was
    depending on the order of the report blocks.
    
    Also fixes issues with multiple report blocks in the SendStatisticsProxy and the
    RtcpStatisticsCallback. SendStatisticsProxy is now aware of RTX ssrcs, and the
    RTCPReceiver is calling the RtcpStatisticsCallback with the correct SSRCs, and
    not only the primary stream SSRC.

    Move pacer to fully use webrtc::Clock instead of webrtc::TickTime.
    
    This required rewriting the send-side delay stats api to be callback based, as otherwise the SuspendBelowMinBitrate test started flaking much more frequently since it had lock order inversion problems.

    Remove the send-side cname getter APIs from voice and video engine.
    
    These APIs aren't being used, and introduces deadlocks when using GetStats() in the new Call api. Having getters for cname at the send-side is pointless, as it's always the user who sets the cname.

    Preserve RTP states for restarted VideoSendStreams.
    
    A restarted VideoSendStream would previously be completely reset,
    causing gaps in sequence numbers and potentially RTP timestamps as well.
    This broke SRTP which requires fairly sequential sequence numbers.
    Presumably, were this sent without SRTP, we'd still have problems on the
    receiving end as the corresponding receiver is unaware of this reset.

    access to ssrc_, ssrc_rtx_ and rtx_.

    Add callbacks for receive channel RTP statistics
    
    This allows a listener to receive new statistics (byte/packet counts, etc) as it
    is generated - avoiding the need to poll. This also makes handling stats from
    multiple RTP streams more tractable. The change is primarily targeted at the new
    video engine API.
    
    TEST=Unit test in ReceiveStatisticsTest.
    Integration tests to follow as call tests when fully wired up.

    Callback for send bitrate estimates - new roll
    
    Issue https://webrtc-codereview.appspot.com/4459004/ was commited as
    r5259, after which flakiness was detected and a rollback was performed
    at r5261.
    
    Patch Set 1 of this issue is the code submitted in r5259. Subsequent
    patch sets fixes a race condition which caused the seen problems.
    
    The root cause was a dead lock between a thread sending rtp packets and
    and a timed module processing thread:
    
    webrtc::RTPSender::BitrateUpdated()  // Get RTPSender stats lock
    webrtc::Bitrate::Process()  // Get Bitrate lock
    webrtc::RTPSender::ProcessBitrate()
    webrtc::ModuleRtpRtcpImpl::Process()
    ...
    
    webrtc::Bitrate::Update()  // Get Bitrate lock
    webrtc::RTPSender::UpdateRtpStats()  // Get RTPSender stats lock
    webrtc::RTPSender::SendToNetwork()
    ...
    
    This is fixed in Bitrate::Process() by releasing the lock before
    calling the callback.

    Upgrade scoped_ptr to Chromium's latest version.
    
    Analogous to the recent libjingle change: http://cl/54929753-p10.
    This supports scoped_ptr<T[]> and scoped_ptr<C, FreeDeleter> rather
    than scoped_array and scoped_ptr_malloc respectively.
    
    - Add Chromium's template-based COMPILE_ASSERT. We didn't have this
    previously in order to support the macro in C. Instead, move the
    existing macro to compile_assert_c.h.
    - Additionally copy the move.h and template_util.h depedencies and add
    the WARN_UNUSED_RESULT macro.
    - Leave scoped_array and scoped_ptr_malloc for now, but mark as
    deprecated.
    - Remove scoped_ptr foo(NULL) use. The default constructor handles it.
    - Remove the now redundant COMPILE_ASSERT from peerconnection_jni.cc.
    - Add a CHECK_ARRAY_SIZE macro to rtp_format_vp8_unittest.cc to remove
    some repeated code.

    Adds support for combining RTX and FEC/RED.
    
    This is accomplished by breaking out RTX and FEC/RED functionality from the RTP module and keeping track of the base payload type, that is the payload type received when not receiving RTX.

    VideoCodingModuleImpl::_receiveCritSect may have been
    acquired. Decode callback needs to acquire the same lock
    in ViEChannel::FrameToRender. It is not a problem for
    SW decode because decode callback is run on the same
    WebRTC decoding thread and the lock is re-entrant. But
    for HW decode, decode callback is run on a thread different
    from WebRTC decoding thread. Decode callback gets the locks
    in the opposite order. Deadlock can happen.

    - Changed RemoteBitrateEstimator::IncomingPacket() to include a const WebRtcRTPHeader& and remove ssrc, rtp_timestamp.
    - Changed RemoteBitrateObserver::OnReceivedBitrateChanged() to use a const & instead of non-const *, to avoid unnecessary copying.
    - Refactored RemoteBitrateEstimatorTest so it can be instantiated for both single and multi stream BWE (first using a parameterized test, but then as a standard test fixture and a few helper functions).
    - Refactored some tests in RemoteBitrateEstimatorTest into a common function CapacityDropTestHelper().

    This means all channels within the same group will share the same pacing queue and scheduler. It also means padding will be computed and sent by a single pacer. To accomplish this I also introduce a PacketRouter which finds the RTP module which owns the packet to be paced out.

    Remove default video encoders for new video API.
    
    Reduces stream creation time significantly. As a side effect also
    removes default encoders for receive-only channels.

    Add support of texture frames for video capturer.
    
    This is a reland of r6252. The video_capture_tests failure on
    builder Android Chromium-APK Tests should be flaky.
    
    - Add ViECapturer unittest.
    - Add CloneFrame function in I420VideoFrame.
    - Encoders do not support texture yet and texture frames
    are dropped in ViEEncoder for now.

    We must remove dependency on Chromium, i.e. we can't use Chromium's base/logging.h. That means we need to define these macros in WebRTC also when doing Chromium builds. And this causes redefinition.

    Add RTC_ prefix to (D)CHECKs and related macros.
    
    We must remove dependency on Chromium, i.e. we can't use Chromium's base/logging.h. That means we need to define these macros in WebRTC also when doing Chromium builds. And this causes redefinition.
    
    Alternative solutions:
    * Check if we already have defined e.g. CHECK, and don't define them in that case. This makes us depend on include order in Chromium, which is not acceptable.
    * Don't allow using the macros in WebRTC headers. Error prone since if someone adds it there by mistake it may compile fine, but later break if a header in added or order is changed in Chromium. That will be confusing and hard to enforce.
    * Ensure that headers that are included by an embedder don't include our macros. This would require some heavy refactoring to be maintainable and enforcable.
    * Changes in Chromium for this is obviously not an option.

    Rename I420VideoFrame to VideoFrame.
    
    This is a mechanical change since it affects so many
    files.
    I420VideoFrame -> VideoFrame
    and reformatted.
    
    Rationale: in the next CL I420VideoFrame will
    get an indication of Pixel Format (I420 for
    starters) and of storage type: usually
    UNOWNED, could be SHMEM, and in the near
    future will be possibly TEXTURE. See
    https://codereview.chromium.org/1154153003
    for the change that happened in Cr.

    Rename I420VideoFrame to VideoFrame.
    
    This is a mechanical change since it affects so many
    files.
    I420VideoFrame -> VideoFrame
    and reformatted.
    
    Rationale: in the next CL I420VideoFrame will
    get an indication of Pixel Format (I420 for
    starters) and of storage type: usually
    UNOWNED, could be SHMEM, and in the near
    future will be possibly TEXTURE. See
    https://codereview.chromium.org/1154153003
    for the change that happened in Cr.

    This CL avoids changing the mentioned callbacks during a call, to avoid
    a potential deadlock when acquiring _sendCritSect and calling

    Moving the critsect revealed a race for the FEC parameters in RtpVideoSender, so the CL grew a bit to avoid this. I also cleaned up some code here at the same time, but tried to keep it at a minimum since this CL had already increased a lot in size.

    This means all channels within the same group will share the same pacing queue and scheduler. It also means padding will be computed and sent by a single pacer. To accomplish this I also introduce a PacketRouter which finds the RTP module which owns the packet to be paced out.

    Instead of setting bitrates based on codec target settings (which may
    have previously been capped by a codec max bitrate), fetch the last
    bandwidth allocated for this channel. This fixes broken low start bitrates
    due to QCIF being set as default codec in WebRtcVideoEngine2 which caps

    I also removed some test form rtp_rtcp_impl_unittest that were affected

    Make SendCodec() lock-free.
    
    Fetching the current codec for sake of gathering stats, is frequently blocked since it's done by acquiring the same lock as is held while encoding frames.  This can mean tens of milliseconds.
    
    To improve this, I'm taking advantage of the fact that the codec information is set on the same thread as is used to query the information.  This means that locking isn't needed for querying this information.  I'm adding checks to make sure debug builds will crash if this isn't followed.
    
    An alternative to this approach could be to add one more lock that is specifically used for the codec information variable.  This would also decouple querying codec information from the encoder itself, but still requires a lock.
    
    This patch depends on making ThreadChecker part of rtc_base_approved:

    Remove call to RtpRtcp::RegisterSendPayload for the default RTP module.
    
    The send payload type is only checked in RTPSender::CheckPayloadType,
    which in turn is only called from SendOutgoingData and never from the
    default module anylonger.

    Use int64_t more consistently for times, in particular for RTT values.
    
    Existing code was inconsistent about whether to use uint16_t, int, unsigned int,
    or uint32_t, and sometimes silently truncated one to another, or truncated
    int64_t.  Because most core time-handling functions use int64_t, being
    consistent about using int64_t unless otherwise necessary minimizes the number

    Reworked paced sender queue
    
    Packet queue in the paced sender is now based on a priority queue rather than having a separate fifo-queue per priority level. This allows more flexible sorting and cleaner usage.
    
    Packets with earlier capture times are now prioritized higher. In situations with high packet loss, the queue might contain packets from several subsequent frames. Retransmit packets from the earlier frames first, since the later ones will probably be dependent on these.
    
    Also, don't force sending of packets after a certain time of inactivity or when packets grow too old, since this was causing consistent overuse on poor connections. Instead, drop frames in vie encoder if pacer queue is too long.

    This is not an error case if for instance an external h.264 encoder is registered, but no internal implementation exists.

    Refactor in BitrateController module.
     - Move condition of 0 bps as max meaning 1gbps from SendSideBandwidthEstimation to BitrateController.
     - Remove condition on bitrate=0 meaning bandwidth estimation off as that could only happen when no observers existed
       and in which case the estimation would be ignored.
     - Add MaybeTriggerOnNetworkChanged which only runs rate allocation if any of the dependent variables has changed
       thus allowing to remove many of the bool returns that try to indicate if the estimation has changed which would not
       be aware if the observers have changed.
     - SendSideBandwidthEstimation now has a UpdateBitrate and has clear code paths to which calls update bitrate.
     - Changes in enforce_min_bitrate so the 10kbps min is set from the BitrateController and not from the outside this keep valid as observers are changed.

    New interface uses two bitrates (max/min). The pace multiplier is also

    Fix a deadlock in ViEEncoder::DeliverFrame.
    
    The deadlock can happen when using HW encoder. HW encoder calls
    the encode complete callback on libjingle worker thread instead
    of ViECaptureThread. The capture thread can hold VieEncoder::|data_cs_|
    and wait for ModuleRtpRtcpImpl::|critical_section_module_ptrs_|.
    When libjingle worker thread runs encode complete callback, it
    can hold ModuleRtpRtcpImpl::|critical_section_module_ptrs_| and

    Adding a new ramp-up-down-up test
    
    The new test is based upon the exisiting rampup test, but also adds
    a low-rate period. The main purpose of the test is to verify the
    SuspendBelowMinBitrate functionality, which must be enabled for the
    test to pass.
    
    The CL also adds a change to the min bitrate in the send-side bandwidth
    estimator when SuspendBelowMinBitrate is enabled.
    
    An anonymous namespace is added around the StreamObserver classes
    in the test to avoid silent linker conflicts that could happen
    otherwise.
    
    Note: this CL depends on https://webrtc-codereview.appspot.com/9049004/

    Set pacing bitrates in SetEncoder.
    
    Before the change no padding was allowed before the first remote bitrate
    estimation was received. This bitrate estimation is based on what's
    actually sent. In tests I set codec.startBitrate to 300 instead of
    325, which incidentally means that only the first layer gets encoded.
    As we only send ~150kbps instead of 300, the first REMB will
    significantly pull down the remote bitrate estimate instead of keeping
    the existing rate, even though there's no problem with the link.
    
    This was detected in RampUpTest.PacingWithRtx,
    (send_config.codec.startBitrate=300), which caused the tests to become a
    lot slower, and flake out more. By allowing padding initially we're able
    to keep our initial bitrate estimate.

    existing macro to compile_assert_c.h.
    - Additionally copy the move.h and template_util.h depedencies and add

    - Leave scoped_array and scoped_ptr_malloc for now, but mark as
    deprecated.
    - Remove scoped_ptr foo(NULL) use. The default constructor handles it.
    - Remove the now redundant COMPILE_ASSERT from peerconnection_jni.cc.

    Cleanup WebRTC tracing
    
    The goal of this change is to:
    1. Remove unused tracing events.
    2. Organize tracing events to facilitate measurement of end to end latency.
    
    The major change in this CL is to use ASYNC_STEP such that operation
    flow can be traced for the same frame.

    Wire up pacer-based padding.
    
    This connects the pacer-based padding with the RTP modules, which will
    generate padding packets roughly according to what the pacer suggests.
    It will only generate padding packets of maximum size to keep the number
    off padding packets as small as possible. This also sets a limit of how much
    padding + media bitrate which the pacer is allowed to "request" from the
    RTP modules.
    
    Padding will for now only be generated by the first sending RTP module.

    With these changes we will assume that the capture time of a frame is based on NTP time. This makes the interface of video engine more well defined and makes it easier and cleaner to handle user provided capture timestamps.
    
    We should consider making the same change to the render timestamps generated at the receiver.

    Add interface to signal a network down event.
    
    - In real-time mode encoding will be paused until the network is back up.
    - In buffering mode the encoder will keep encoding, and packets will be
      buffered at the sender. When the buffer grows above the target delay
      encoding will be paused.
    - Fixes a couple of issues related to pacing which was found with the new test.
    - Introduces different max bitrates for pacing and for encoding. This allows
      the pacer to faster get rid of the queue after a network down event.

    Move SetTargetSendBitrates logic from default module to payload router.
    
    This cl just moves the logic form the default module
    SetTargetSendBitrates to PayloadRouter. There might be glitch / mismatch
    in size between trate the vector and rtp modules. This was the same in
    the default module and is quite hard to protect from before we have the
    new video API.
    
    I also removed some test form rtp_rtcp_impl_unittest that were affected
    by this change. The test tests code that isn't implemented, hence the
    DISABLED_, and this will never be implemented in the RTP module, rather
    the payload router in the future.

    Remove uses of build date/time.
    
    Uses of __DATE__ and __TIME__ are blocking deterministic Chromium
    builds. We're not really making use of these, and if anything they're
    likely to be misleading as it's impossible to distinguish between a new
    revision and a freshly-built old branch.

    Landing pkasting's webrtc fixes for MSVC level 4 warnings in WebRTC.
    ---
    
    Fixes for re-enabling more MSVC level 4 warnings: webrtc/ edition
    
    This contains fixes for the following sorts of issues:
    * Possibly-uninitialized local variable
    * Signedness mismatch
    * Assignment inside conditional
    
    This also contains a small number of other cleanups to nearby code. In
    particular several warning-disables for MSVC are removed because they don't seem
    to be necessary (either that warning is not enabled or the code does not trigger
    it).

    Raise kViEMaxNumberOfChannels from 32 to 64
    
    Recent testing has shown that on modern desktops and laptops, decoding more than
    32 low-resolution realtime video streams simultaneously is both possible and
    desirable.

    Remove channel ids from various interfaces.
    
    Starts by removing channel/engine id from ViEChannel which propagates
    down to the RTP/RTCP module as well as the transport class.
    
    IncomingVideoStream::RenderFrame() is untouched for now but receives a
    fake id instead of the previous channel id. Added a TODO to remove it
    later but the RenderFrame call is implemented in a lot of
    platform-dependent files and should probably remove the "manager" aspect
    of renderers, so preferring to do it separately

    Support handling multiple RTX but only generate SDP with RTX associated with VP8.
    
    This implementation registers RTX-APT map inside RTP sender and receiver.
    While it only generates SDP with RTX associated with VP8 to make it
    compatible with previous Chrome versions.
    
    Should add following changes after reaches stable,
    * Use RTX-APT map for building and restoring RTP packets.
    * Add RTX support for RED or VP9 in Video engine.
    * Set RTX payload type for RED inside FecConfig in EndToEndTest.

    Use int64_t more consistently for times, in particular for RTT values.
    
    Existing code was inconsistent about whether to use uint16_t, int, unsigned int,
    or uint32_t, and sometimes silently truncated one to another, or truncated
    int64_t.  Because most core time-handling functions use int64_t, being
    consistent about using int64_t unless otherwise necessary minimizes the number
    of explicit or implicit casts.

    Estimating NTP time with a given RTT.
    
    RemoteNtpTimeEstimator needed user to give a remote SSRC and it intended to call RtpRtcp module to obtain RTT, to be able to calculate Ntp time.
    
    When RTT cannot be directly obtained from the RtpRtcp module with the specified SSRC, RemoteNtpTimeEstimator would fail.
    
    This change allows RemoteNtpTimeEstimator to calculate NTP with an external RTT estimate.
    
    An immediate benefit is that capture_start_ntp_time_ms_ can be obtained in a Google hangout call.

    Have RTX be enabled by setting an RTX payload type instead of by setting an RTX SSRC.
    
    This makes it easier to disable RTX by filtering out the RTX codec during call setup/signaling, and won't require that also the SSRCs are filtered out.

    Ignore the return value of UpdateRtcpTimestamp instead of printing warning. Because UpdateRtcpTimestamp may fail when there's no valid RTCP SR, which can happen in the first couple seconds or when the channel is a send only channel. Either case we don't want the warning log.

    - An RTX packet with no payload should be dropped prior to parsing RTX header since it doesn't have an RTX header. This can for example happen when sending padding-only packets over the RTX stream.
    - The retransmit code path when the pacer is disabled doesn't properly update the abs-send-time and ts-offset header extensions.

    Fix for making sure that the packet in order checks are done prior to updating the last received packet state.
    
    Without this fix all packets are considered out-of-order by the rtp receiver, causing the last received state
    in the rtp receiver to never get valid.
    
    Also makes sure that only valid timestamps and receive times are used for audio/video sync.

    Adds support for combining RTX and FEC/RED.
    
    This is accomplished by breaking out RTX and FEC/RED functionality from the RTP module and keeping track of the base payload type, that is the payload type received when not receiving RTX.
    
    Enables retransmissions over RTX by default in the loopback test.

    Use int64_t more consistently for times, in particular for RTT values.
    
    Existing code was inconsistent about whether to use uint16_t, int, unsigned int,
    or uint32_t, and sometimes silently truncated one to another, or truncated
    int64_t.  Because most core time-handling functions use int64_t, being
    consistent about using int64_t unless otherwise necessary minimizes the number
    of explicit or implicit casts.

    Use int64_t for milliseconds more often, primarily for TimeUntilNextProcess.
    
    This fixes a variety of MSVC warnings about value truncations when implicitly
    storing the 64-bit values we get back from e.g. TimeTicks in 32-bit objects, and
    removes the need for a number of explicit casts.
    
    This also moves a number of constants so they're declared right where they're used, which is easier to read and maintain, and makes some of them of integral type rather than using the "enum hack".

    Remove channel ids from various interfaces.
    
    Starts by removing channel/engine id from ViEChannel which propagates
    down to the RTP/RTCP module as well as the transport class.
    
    IncomingVideoStream::RenderFrame() is untouched for now but receives a
    fake id instead of the previous channel id. Added a TODO to remove it
    later but the RenderFrame call is implemented in a lot of
    platform-dependent files and should probably remove the "manager" aspect
    of renderers, so preferring to do it separately

    Removes the OVERRIDE macro defined in:
    * webrtc/base/common.h
    * webrtc/typedefs.h
    
    The majority of the source changes were done by running this in src/:
    perl -0pi -e "s/virtual\s([^({;]*(\([^({;]*\)[^({;]*))(OVERRIDE|override)/\1override/sg" `find {talk,webrtc} -name "*.h"  -o -name "*.cc*" -o -name "*.mm*"`
    
    which converted all:
    virtual Foo() OVERRIDE
    functions to:
    Foo() override
    
    Then I manually edited:
    * talk/media/webrtc/fakewebrtccommon.h
    * webrtc/test/fake_common.h
    
    Remaining uses of OVERRIDE was fixed by search+replace.
    
    Manual edits were done to fix virtual destructors that were
    overriding inherited ones.
    
    Finally a build error related to the pure virtual definitions of
    Read, Write and Rewind in common_types.h required a bit of
    refactoring in:
    * webrtc/common_types.cc
    * webrtc/common_types.h
    * webrtc/system_wrappers/interface/file_wrapper.h
    * webrtc/system_wrappers/source/file_impl.cc
    
    This roll should make it possible for us to finally re-enable deadlock
    detection for TSan on the buildbots.

    2. We're trying to do an M41 webrtc roll in Chromium, and this CL is risky.

    Mark all virtual overrides in the hierarchy of RtpData and RtpReceiver as such.
    
    This will make further changes to these classes safer by ensuring that the
    compile breaks if the base class changes and not all overrides are fixed.
    
    This also highlighted a number of unused functions which I've removed.

    Have RTX be enabled by setting an RTX payload type instead of by setting an RTX SSRC.
    
    This makes it easier to disable RTX by filtering out the RTX codec during call setup/signaling, and won't require that also the SSRCs are filtered out.

    Change GetEstimatedSend/RecvBandwidth to return the total bandwidth of a channel group instead of splitting it up among channels.
    
    This fixes an issue where the user doesn't know which channels are "active" and therefore can't properly sum the estimates for all channels.

    Add callbacks for receive channel RTP statistics
    
    This allows a listener to receive new statistics (byte/packet counts, etc) as it
    is generated - avoiding the need to poll. This also makes handling stats from
    multiple RTP streams more tractable. The change is primarily targeted at the new
    video engine API.
    
    TEST=Unit test in ReceiveStatisticsTest.
    Integration tests to follow as call tests when fully wired up.

    Fix for making sure that the packet in order checks are done prior to updating the last received packet state.
    
    Without this fix all packets are considered out-of-order by the rtp receiver, causing the last received state
    in the rtp receiver to never get valid.
    
    Also makes sure that only valid timestamps and receive times are used for audio/video sync.

    Add RTC_ prefix to (D)CHECKs and related macros.
    
    We must remove dependency on Chromium, i.e. we can't use Chromium's base/logging.h. That means we need to define these macros in WebRTC also when doing Chromium builds. And this causes redefinition.
    
    Alternative solutions:
    * Check if we already have defined e.g. CHECK, and don't define them in that case. This makes us depend on include order in Chromium, which is not acceptable.
    * Don't allow using the macros in WebRTC headers. Error prone since if someone adds it there by mistake it may compile fine, but later break if a header in added or order is changed in Chromium. That will be confusing and hard to enforce.

    Add RTC_ prefix to (D)CHECKs and related macros.
    
    We must remove dependency on Chromium, i.e. we can't use Chromium's base/logging.h. That means we need to define these macros in WebRTC also when doing Chromium builds. And this causes redefinition.
    
    Alternative solutions:
    * Check if we already have defined e.g. CHECK, and don't define them in that case. This makes us depend on include order in Chromium, which is not acceptable.
    * Don't allow using the macros in WebRTC headers. Error prone since if someone adds it there by mistake it may compile fine, but later break if a header in added or order is changed in Chromium. That will be confusing and hard to enforce.
    * Ensure that headers that are included by an embedder don't include our macros. This would require some heavy refactoring to be maintainable and enforcable.
    * Changes in Chromium for this is obviously not an option.

    Roll chromium_revision e144d30..6fdb142 (318658:318841) + remove OVERRIDE macro
    
    Clang version changed 223108:230914
    Details: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/e144d30..6fdb142/tools/clang/scripts/update.sh
    
    Removes the OVERRIDE macro defined in:
    * webrtc/base/common.h
    * webrtc/typedefs.h
    
    The majority of the source changes were done by running this in src/:
    perl -0pi -e "s/virtual\s([^({;]*(\([^({;]*\)[^({;]*))(OVERRIDE|override)/\1override/sg" `find {talk,webrtc} -name "*.h"  -o -name "*.cc*" -o -name "*.mm*"`
    
    which converted all:
    virtual Foo() OVERRIDE
    functions to:
    Foo() override
    
    Then I manually edited:
    * talk/media/webrtc/fakewebrtccommon.h
    * webrtc/test/fake_common.h
    
    Remaining uses of OVERRIDE was fixed by search+replace.
    
    Manual edits were done to fix virtual destructors that were
    overriding inherited ones.
    
    Finally a build error related to the pure virtual definitions of
    Read, Write and Rewind in common_types.h required a bit of
    refactoring in:
    * webrtc/common_types.cc
    * webrtc/common_types.h
    * webrtc/system_wrappers/interface/file_wrapper.h
    * webrtc/system_wrappers/source/file_impl.cc
    
    This roll should make it possible for us to finally re-enable deadlock
    detection for TSan on the buildbots.

    Use int64_t for milliseconds more often, primarily for TimeUntilNextProcess.
    
    This fixes a variety of MSVC warnings about value truncations when implicitly
    storing the 64-bit values we get back from e.g. TimeTicks in 32-bit objects, and
    removes the need for a number of explicit casts.
    
    This also moves a number of constants so they're declared right where they're used, which is easier to read and maintain, and makes some of them of integral type rather than using the "enum hack".

    Mark all virtual overrides in the hierarchy of Module as virtual and OVERRIDE.
    
    This will make a subsequent change I intend to do safer, where I'll change the
    return type of one of the base Module functions, by breaking the compile if I
    miss any overrides.
    
    This also highlighted a number of unused functions (in many cases apparently
    virtual "overrides" of no-longer-existent base functions).  I've removed some of
    these.
    
    This also highlighted several cases where "virtual" was used unnecessarily to
    mark a function that was only defined in one class.  Removed "virtual" in those
    cases.

    Breaking out receive-stats, rtp-payload-registry and rtp-receiver from the
    rtp_rtcp implementation.
    
    This refactoring significantly reduces the receive-side RTP parser and receiver
    complexity, and makes it possible to implement RTX correctly by having two
    instances of receive-statistics.
    
    With this change the dead-or-alive and packet timeout APIs are removed.

    Roll chromium_revision e144d30..6fdb142 (318658:318841) + remove OVERRIDE macro
    
    Clang version changed 223108:230914
    Details: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/e144d30..6fdb142/tools/clang/scripts/update.sh
    
    Removes the OVERRIDE macro defined in:
    * webrtc/base/common.h
    * webrtc/typedefs.h
    
    The majority of the source changes were done by running this in src/:
    perl -0pi -e "s/virtual\s([^({;]*(\([^({;]*\)[^({;]*))(OVERRIDE|override)/\1override/sg" `find {talk,webrtc} -name "*.h"  -o -name "*.cc*" -o -name "*.mm*"`
    
    which converted all:
    virtual Foo() OVERRIDE
    functions to:
    Foo() override
    
    Then I manually edited:
    * talk/media/webrtc/fakewebrtccommon.h
    * webrtc/test/fake_common.h
    
    Remaining uses of OVERRIDE was fixed by search+replace.
    
    Manual edits were done to fix virtual destructors that were
    overriding inherited ones.
    
    Finally a build error related to the pure virtual definitions of
    Read, Write and Rewind in common_types.h required a bit of
    refactoring in:
    * webrtc/common_types.cc
    * webrtc/common_types.h
    * webrtc/system_wrappers/interface/file_wrapper.h
    * webrtc/system_wrappers/source/file_impl.cc
    
    This roll should make it possible for us to finally re-enable deadlock
    detection for TSan on the buildbots.

    Overuse detection based on capture-input jitter.
    
    This is believed to be more reliable in real-world cases. The camera seems to fall behind sooner than the encoder starts taking too long time encoding, so this is believed to be an earlier trigger.

    Roll chromium_revision e144d30..6fdb142 (318658:318841) + remove OVERRIDE macro
    
    Clang version changed 223108:230914

    Removes the OVERRIDE macro defined in:
    * webrtc/base/common.h
    * webrtc/typedefs.h
    
    The majority of the source changes were done by running this in src/:
    perl -0pi -e "s/virtual\s([^({;]*(\([^({;]*\)[^({;]*))(OVERRIDE|override)/\1override/sg" `find {talk,webrtc} -name "*.h"  -o -name "*.cc*" -o -name "*.mm*"`
    
    which converted all:
    virtual Foo() OVERRIDE
    functions to:
    Foo() override
    
    Then I manually edited:
    * talk/media/webrtc/fakewebrtccommon.h
    * webrtc/test/fake_common.h
    
    Remaining uses of OVERRIDE was fixed by search+replace.
    
    Manual edits were done to fix virtual destructors that were
    overriding inherited ones.
    
    Finally a build error related to the pure virtual definitions of
    Read, Write and Rewind in common_types.h required a bit of
    refactoring in:
    * webrtc/common_types.cc
    * webrtc/common_types.h
    * webrtc/system_wrappers/interface/file_wrapper.h
    * webrtc/system_wrappers/source/file_impl.cc
    
    This roll should make it possible for us to finally re-enable deadlock
    detection for TSan on the buildbots.

    Use int64_t more consistently for times, in particular for RTT values.
    
    Existing code was inconsistent about whether to use uint16_t, int, unsigned int,
    or uint32_t, and sometimes silently truncated one to another, or truncated
    int64_t.  Because most core time-handling functions use int64_t, being

    Use int64_t for milliseconds more often, primarily for TimeUntilNextProcess.
    
    This fixes a variety of MSVC warnings about value truncations when implicitly
    storing the 64-bit values we get back from e.g. TimeTicks in 32-bit objects, and
    removes the need for a number of explicit casts.
    
    This also moves a number of constants so they're declared right where they're used, which is easier to read and maintain, and makes some of them of integral type rather than using the "enum hack".

    Mark all virtual overrides in the hierarchy of Module as virtual and OVERRIDE.
    
    This will make a subsequent change I intend to do safer, where I'll change the
    return type of one of the base Module functions, by breaking the compile if I
    miss any overrides.
    
    This also highlighted a number of unused functions (in many cases apparently
    virtual "overrides" of no-longer-existent base functions).  I've removed some of
    these.
    
    This also highlighted several cases where "virtual" was used unnecessarily to
    mark a function that was only defined in one class.  Removed "virtual" in those
    cases.

    Move SetTargetSendBitrates logic from default module to payload router.
    
    This cl just moves the logic form the default module
    SetTargetSendBitrates to PayloadRouter. There might be glitch / mismatch
    in size between trate the vector and rtp modules. This was the same in
    the default module and is quite hard to protect from before we have the
    new video API.
    
    I also removed some test form rtp_rtcp_impl_unittest that were affected
    by this change. The test tests code that isn't implemented, hence the
    DISABLED_, and this will never be implemented in the RTP module, rather
    the payload router in the future.

    There is a potential race when deleting a channel and there is a frame
    in the encoder. ViEEncoder::SendData can be called after
    ViEEncoder::StopThreadsAndRemovePayloadRouter and payload_router is
    then already removed.
    
    Until we have the new API in place, use scoped_refptr in ViEChannel and

    Moving functionality to get max payload length from default RTP module
    to the payload router.

    Add support of texture frames for video capturer.
    
    This is a reland of r6252. The video_capture_tests failure on
    builder Android Chromium-APK Tests should be flaky.
    
    - Add ViECapturer unittest.
    - Add CloneFrame function in I420VideoFrame.
    - Encoders do not support texture yet and texture frames

    - Changed RemoteBitrateObserver::OnReceivedBitrateChanged() to use a const & instead of non-const *, to avoid unnecessary copying.
    - Refactored RemoteBitrateEstimatorTest so it can be instantiated for both single and multi stream BWE (first using a parameterized test, but then as a standard test fixture and a few helper functions).
    - Refactored some tests in RemoteBitrateEstimatorTest into a common function CapacityDropTestHelper().

    Remove channel ids from various interfaces.
    
    Starts by removing channel/engine id from ViEChannel which propagates
    down to the RTP/RTCP module as well as the transport class.
    
    IncomingVideoStream::RenderFrame() is untouched for now but receives a
    fake id instead of the previous channel id. Added a TODO to remove it
    later but the RenderFrame call is implemented in a lot of
    platform-dependent files and should probably remove the "manager" aspect
    of renderers, so preferring to do it separately

    Add RTC_ prefix to (D)CHECKs and related macros.
    
    We must remove dependency on Chromium, i.e. we can't use Chromium's base/logging.h. That means we need to define these macros in WebRTC also when doing Chromium builds. And this causes redefinition.
    
    Alternative solutions:
    * Check if we already have defined e.g. CHECK, and don't define them in that case. This makes us depend on include order in Chromium, which is not acceptable.
    * Don't allow using the macros in WebRTC headers. Error prone since if someone adds it there by mistake it may compile fine, but later break if a header in added or order is changed in Chromium. That will be confusing and hard to enforce.
    * Ensure that headers that are included by an embedder don't include our macros. This would require some heavy refactoring to be maintainable and enforcable.
    * Changes in Chromium for this is obviously not an option.

    Add TransportFeedback adapter, adapting remote feedback to bwe estiamtor
    
    When using send-side bandwidth estimation, the inter-packet delay is
    reported back to the sender using RTCP TransportFeedback messages.
    Theis data needs to be translated into a format which the bandwidth
    estimator (now instantiated on the send side) can use, including looking
    up the local absolute send time from the send time history.

    Remove ViEChannel simulcast lock.
    
    Since the number of streams is now known on construction we can
    initialize all RTP modules on construction. They are internally locked
    so we don't nede a simulcast lock anymore.

    This means all channels within the same group will share the same pacing queue and scheduler. It also means padding will be computed and sent by a single pacer. To accomplish this I also introduce a PacketRouter which finds the RTP module which owns the packet to be paced out.

    Roll chromium_revision e144d30..6fdb142 (318658:318841) + remove OVERRIDE macro
    
    Clang version changed 223108:230914
    Details: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/e144d30..6fdb142/tools/clang/scripts/update.sh
    
    Removes the OVERRIDE macro defined in:
    * webrtc/base/common.h
    * webrtc/typedefs.h
    
    The majority of the source changes were done by running this in src/:
    perl -0pi -e "s/virtual\s([^({;]*(\([^({;]*\)[^({;]*))(OVERRIDE|override)/\1override/sg" `find {talk,webrtc} -name "*.h"  -o -name "*.cc*" -o -name "*.mm*"`
    
    which converted all:
    virtual Foo() OVERRIDE
    functions to:
    Foo() override
    
    Then I manually edited:
    * talk/media/webrtc/fakewebrtccommon.h
    * webrtc/test/fake_common.h
    
    Remaining uses of OVERRIDE was fixed by search+replace.
    
    Manual edits were done to fix virtual destructors that were
    overriding inherited ones.
    
    Finally a build error related to the pure virtual definitions of
    Read, Write and Rewind in common_types.h required a bit of
    refactoring in:
    * webrtc/common_types.cc
    * webrtc/common_types.h
    * webrtc/system_wrappers/interface/file_wrapper.h
    * webrtc/system_wrappers/source/file_impl.cc
    
    This roll should make it possible for us to finally re-enable deadlock
    detection for TSan on the buildbots.

    Use int64_t more consistently for times, in particular for RTT values.
    
    Existing code was inconsistent about whether to use uint16_t, int, unsigned int,
    or uint32_t, and sometimes silently truncated one to another, or truncated
    int64_t.  Because most core time-handling functions use int64_t, being
    consistent about using int64_t unless otherwise necessary minimizes the number
    of explicit or implicit casts.

    Use int64_t for milliseconds more often, primarily for TimeUntilNextProcess.
    
    This fixes a variety of MSVC warnings about value truncations when implicitly
    storing the 64-bit values we get back from e.g. TimeTicks in 32-bit objects, and
    removes the need for a number of explicit casts.
    
    This also moves a number of constants so they're declared right where they're used, which is easier to read and maintain, and makes some of them of integral type rather than using the "enum hack".

    Mark all virtual overrides in the hierarchy of Module as virtual and OVERRIDE.
    
    This will make a subsequent change I intend to do safer, where I'll change the
    return type of one of the base Module functions, by breaking the compile if I
    miss any overrides.
    
    This also highlighted a number of unused functions (in many cases apparently
    virtual "overrides" of no-longer-existent base functions).  I've removed some of
    these.
    
    This also highlighted several cases where "virtual" was used unnecessarily to
    mark a function that was only defined in one class.  Removed "virtual" in those
    cases.

    Modify bitrate controller to update bitrate based on process call and not
    only whenever a RTCP receiver block is received.
    
    Additionally:
     Add condition to only start rampup after a receiver block is received. This was same as old behaviour but now an explicit check is needed to verify process does not ramps up before the first block.
    
     Fix logic around capping max bitrate increase at 8% per second. Before it was only increasing once every 1 second and each increase would be as high as 8%. If receiver blocks had a different interval before it would lose an update or waste an update slot and not ramp up as much as a 8% (e.g. if RTCP received < 1 second).
    
     Did not touch decrease logic, however since it can be triggered more often it
     may decrease much faster and closer to the original written cap of once every
     300ms + rtt.
    
    Note:
     rampup_tests.cc don't seem to be affected by this since there is no packet loss or REMB that go higher than expected cap.
     bitrate_controller_unittests.cc are don't really simulate a clock and the process thread, but trigger update by inserting an rtcp block.

    Modify bitrate controller to update bitrate based on process call and not
    only whenever a RTCP receiver block is received.
    
    Additionally:
     Add condition to only start rampup after a receiver block is received. This was same as old behaviour but now an explicit check is needed to verify process does not ramps up before the first block.
    
     Fix logic around capping max bitrate increase at 8% per second. Before it was only increasing once every 1 second and each increase would be as high as 8%. If receiver blocks had a different interval before it would lose an update or waste an update slot and not ramp up as much as a 8% (e.g. if RTCP received < 1 second).
    
     Did not touch decrease logic, however since it can be triggered more often it
     may decrease much faster and closer to the original written cap of once every
     300ms + rtt.
    
    Note:
     rampup_tests.cc don't seem to be affected by this since there is no packet loss or REMB that go higher than expected cap.

    Changing the bitrate clamping in BitrateControllerImpl
    
    This CL implements an alternative to the bitrate clamping that is done
    in BitrateControllerImpl. The default behavior is unchanged, but if
    the new algorithm is enabled the behavior is as follows:
    When the new bitrate is lower than the sum of min bitrates, the
    algorithm will give each observer up to its min bitrate, one
    observer at a time, until the bitrate budget is depleted. Thus,
    with this change, some observers may get less than their min bitrate,
    or even zero.
    
    Unit tests are implemented.
    
    Also fixing two old lint warnings in the affected files.
    
    This change is related to the auto-muter feature.

    Use int64_t more consistently for times, in particular for RTT values.
    
    Existing code was inconsistent about whether to use uint16_t, int, unsigned int,
    or uint32_t, and sometimes silently truncated one to another, or truncated
    int64_t.  Because most core time-handling functions use int64_t, being
    consistent about using int64_t unless otherwise necessary minimizes the number
    of explicit or implicit casts.

    Add RTC_ prefix to (D)CHECKs and related macros.
    
    We must remove dependency on Chromium, i.e. we can't use Chromium's base/logging.h. That means we need to define these macros in WebRTC also when doing Chromium builds. And this causes redefinition.
    
    Alternative solutions:
    * Check if we already have defined e.g. CHECK, and don't define them in that case. This makes us depend on include order in Chromium, which is not acceptable.
    * Don't allow using the macros in WebRTC headers. Error prone since if someone adds it there by mistake it may compile fine, but later break if a header in added or order is changed in Chromium. That will be confusing and hard to enforce.
    * Ensure that headers that are included by an embedder don't include our macros. This would require some heavy refactoring to be maintainable and enforcable.
    * Changes in Chromium for this is obviously not an option.

    Move frame input (ViECapturer) to webrtc/video/.
    
    Renames ViECapturer to VideoCaptureInput and initializes several
    parameters on construction instead of setters.
    
    Also removes an old deadlock suppression.

    Use int64_t for milliseconds more often, primarily for TimeUntilNextProcess.
    
    This fixes a variety of MSVC warnings about value truncations when implicitly
    storing the 64-bit values we get back from e.g. TimeTicks in 32-bit objects, and
    removes the need for a number of explicit casts.
    
    This also moves a number of constants so they're declared right where they're used, which is easier to read and maintain, and makes some of them of integral type rather than using the "enum hack".

    Raw packet loss rate reported by RTP_RTCP module may vary too drastically over time. This CL is to add a filter to the value in VoE before lending it to audio coding module.
    
    The filter is an exponential filter borrowed from video coding module.
    
    The method is written in a new class called PacketLossProtector (not sure if the name is nice), which can be used in the future for more sophisticated logic.

    Overuse detection based on capture-input jitter.
    
    This is believed to be more reliable in real-world cases. The camera seems to fall behind sooner than the encoder starts taking too long time encoding, so this is believed to be an earlier trigger.

    Use int64_t for milliseconds more often, primarily for TimeUntilNextProcess.
    
    This fixes a variety of MSVC warnings about value truncations when implicitly
    storing the 64-bit values we get back from e.g. TimeTicks in 32-bit objects, and
    removes the need for a number of explicit casts.
    
    This also moves a number of constants so they're declared right where they're used, which is easier to read and maintain, and makes some of them of integral type rather than using the "enum hack".

    Fix for making sure that the packet in order checks are done prior to updating the last received packet state.
    
    Without this fix all packets are considered out-of-order by the rtp receiver, causing the last received state
    in the rtp receiver to never get valid.

    Fix suspend below min bitrate in new API by making it possible to set min bitrate at the receive-side.
    
    In addition to this the ramp-up tests are refactored to use a receive call instead of only a remote bitrate estimator, and to make use of BaseTest.

    Remove channel ids from various interfaces.
    
    Starts by removing channel/engine id from ViEChannel which propagates
    down to the RTP/RTCP module as well as the transport class.
    
    IncomingVideoStream::RenderFrame() is untouched for now but receives a
    fake id instead of the previous channel id. Added a TODO to remove it
    later but the RenderFrame call is implemented in a lot of
    platform-dependent files and should probably remove the "manager" aspect
    of renderers, so preferring to do it separately

    Add TransportFeedback adapter, adapting remote feedback to bwe estiamtor
    
    When using send-side bandwidth estimation, the inter-packet delay is
    reported back to the sender using RTCP TransportFeedback messages.
    Theis data needs to be translated into a format which the bandwidth
    estimator (now instantiated on the send side) can use, including looking
    up the local absolute send time from the send time history.

    Moving the pacer and the pacer thread to ChannelGroup.
    
    This means all channels within the same group will share the same pacing queue and scheduler. It also means padding will be computed and sent by a single pacer. To accomplish this I also introduce a PacketRouter which finds the RTP module which owns the packet to be paced out.

    Break out allocation from BitrateController into a BitrateAllocator.
    
    This also refactors some of the padding and allocation code in ViEEncoder, and
    makes ChannelGroup a simple forwarder from BitrateController to
    BitrateAllocator.

    Moving the pacer and the pacer thread to ChannelGroup.
    
    This means all channels within the same group will share the same pacing queue and scheduler. It also means padding will be computed and sent by a single pacer. To accomplish this I also introduce a PacketRouter which finds the RTP module which owns the packet to be paced out.

    Move SetTargetSendBitrates logic from default module to payload router.
    
    This cl just moves the logic form the default module
    SetTargetSendBitrates to PayloadRouter. There might be glitch / mismatch
    in size between trate the vector and rtp modules. This was the same in
    the default module and is quite hard to protect from before we have the
    new video API.
    
    I also removed some test form rtp_rtcp_impl_unittest that were affected
    by this change. The test tests code that isn't implemented, hence the
    DISABLED_, and this will never be implemented in the RTP module, rather
    the payload router in the future.

    I420VideoFrame -> VideoFrame
    and reformatted.
    
    Rationale: in the next CL I420VideoFrame will
    get an indication of Pixel Format (I420 for
    starters) and of storage type: usually
    UNOWNED, could be SHMEM, and in the near
    future will be possibly TEXTURE. See

    Rename I420VideoFrame to VideoFrame.
    
    This is a mechanical change since it affects so many
    files.
    I420VideoFrame -> VideoFrame
    and reformatted.
    
    Rationale: in the next CL I420VideoFrame will
    get an indication of Pixel Format (I420 for
    starters) and of storage type: usually
    UNOWNED, could be SHMEM, and in the near
    future will be possibly TEXTURE. See
    https://codereview.chromium.org/1154153003
    for the change that happened in Cr.

    Without this, external encoders with internal sources (i.e. don't use the normal camera path) won't trigger ViEEncoder::DeliverFrame, so time_of_last_incoming_frame_ms_ will always be 0.

    Avoid critsect for protection- and qm setting callbacks in VideoSender.
    
    This CL avoids changing the mentioned callbacks during a call, to avoid
    a potential deadlock when acquiring _sendCritSect and calling

    Moving the critsect revealed a race for the FEC parameters in RtpVideoSender, so the CL grew a bit to avoid this. I also cleaned up some code here at the same time, but tried to keep it at a minimum since this CL had already increased a lot in size.

    Roll chromium_revision e144d30..6fdb142 (318658:318841) + remove OVERRIDE macro
    
    Clang version changed 223108:230914
    Details: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/e144d30..6fdb142/tools/clang/scripts/update.sh
    
    Removes the OVERRIDE macro defined in:
    * webrtc/base/common.h
    * webrtc/typedefs.h
    
    The majority of the source changes were done by running this in src/:
    perl -0pi -e "s/virtual\s([^({;]*(\([^({;]*\)[^({;]*))(OVERRIDE|override)/\1override/sg" `find {talk,webrtc} -name "*.h"  -o -name "*.cc*" -o -name "*.mm*"`
    
    which converted all:
    virtual Foo() OVERRIDE
    functions to:
    Foo() override
    
    Then I manually edited:
    * talk/media/webrtc/fakewebrtccommon.h
    * webrtc/test/fake_common.h
    
    Remaining uses of OVERRIDE was fixed by search+replace.
    
    Manual edits were done to fix virtual destructors that were
    overriding inherited ones.
    
    Finally a build error related to the pure virtual definitions of
    Read, Write and Rewind in common_types.h required a bit of
    refactoring in:
    * webrtc/common_types.cc
    * webrtc/common_types.h
    * webrtc/system_wrappers/interface/file_wrapper.h
    * webrtc/system_wrappers/source/file_impl.cc
    
    This roll should make it possible for us to finally re-enable deadlock
    detection for TSan on the buildbots.

    Roll chromium_revision e144d30..6fdb142 (318658:318841) + remove OVERRIDE macro
    
    Clang version changed 223108:230914
    Details: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/e144d30..6fdb142/tools/clang/scripts/update.sh
    
    Removes the OVERRIDE macro defined in:
    * webrtc/base/common.h
    * webrtc/typedefs.h
    
    The majority of the source changes were done by running this in src/:
    perl -0pi -e "s/virtual\s([^({;]*(\([^({;]*\)[^({;]*))(OVERRIDE|override)/\1override/sg" `find {talk,webrtc} -name "*.h"  -o -name "*.cc*" -o -name "*.mm*"`
    
    which converted all:
    virtual Foo() OVERRIDE
    functions to:
    Foo() override
    
    Then I manually edited:
    * talk/media/webrtc/fakewebrtccommon.h
    * webrtc/test/fake_common.h
    
    Remaining uses of OVERRIDE was fixed by search+replace.
    
    Manual edits were done to fix virtual destructors that were
    overriding inherited ones.
    
    Finally a build error related to the pure virtual definitions of
    Read, Write and Rewind in common_types.h required a bit of
    refactoring in:
    * webrtc/common_types.cc
    * webrtc/common_types.h
    * webrtc/system_wrappers/interface/file_wrapper.h
    * webrtc/system_wrappers/source/file_impl.cc
    
    This roll should make it possible for us to finally re-enable deadlock
    detection for TSan on the buildbots.

    Break out allocation from BitrateController into a BitrateAllocator.
    
    This also refactors some of the padding and allocation code in ViEEncoder, and
    makes ChannelGroup a simple forwarder from BitrateController to
    BitrateAllocator.

    Fix shutdown race for ViEEncoder when there is a frame in the encoder.
    
    There is a potential race when deleting a channel and there is a frame
    in the encoder. ViEEncoder::SendData can be called after
    ViEEncoder::StopThreadsAndRemovePayloadRouter and payload_router is
    then already removed.
    
    Until we have the new API in place, use scoped_refptr in ViEChannel and
    ViEEncoder and deregister channel/encoder before deleting.

    Existing code was inconsistent about whether to use uint16_t, int, unsigned int,

    int64_t.  Because most core time-handling functions use int64_t, being

    Reworked paced sender queue
    
    Packet queue in the paced sender is now based on a priority queue rather than having a separate fifo-queue per priority level. This allows more flexible sorting and cleaner usage.
    
    Packets with earlier capture times are now prioritized higher. In situations with high packet loss, the queue might contain packets from several subsequent frames. Retransmit packets from the earlier frames first, since the later ones will probably be dependent on these.
    
    Also, don't force sending of packets after a certain time of inactivity or when packets grow too old, since this was causing consistent overuse on poor connections. Instead, drop frames in vie encoder if pacer queue is too long.

    Mark all virtual overrides in the hierarchies of RtpDump and
    VCMPacketizationCallback as such.
    
    This will make further changes to these classes safer by ensuring that the

    This fixes an issue where the user doesn't know which channels are "active" and therefore can't properly sum the estimates for all channels.

    estimates (bitrate estimation dips) when encoding non-complex content
    such as screenshare of a static image even though there's nothing wrong
    with the link.

    Wire up pacer-based padding.
    
    This connects the pacer-based padding with the RTP modules, which will
    generate padding packets roughly according to what the pacer suggests.
    It will only generate padding packets of maximum size to keep the number
    off padding packets as small as possible. This also sets a limit of how much
    padding + media bitrate which the pacer is allowed to "request" from the
    RTP modules.
    
    Padding will for now only be generated by the first sending RTP module.

    Add interface to signal a network down event.
    
    - In real-time mode encoding will be paused until the network is back up.
    - In buffering mode the encoder will keep encoding, and packets will be
      buffered at the sender. When the buffer grows above the target delay
      encoding will be paused.
    - Fixes a couple of issues related to pacing which was found with the new test.
    - Introduces different max bitrates for pacing and for encoding. This allows
      the pacer to faster get rid of the queue after a network down event.

    Removes the OVERRIDE macro defined in:
    * webrtc/base/common.h
    * webrtc/typedefs.h
    
    The majority of the source changes were done by running this in src/:
    perl -0pi -e "s/virtual\s([^({;]*(\([^({;]*\)[^({;]*))(OVERRIDE|override)/\1override/sg" `find {talk,webrtc} -name "*.h"  -o -name "*.cc*" -o -name "*.mm*"`
    
    which converted all:
    virtual Foo() OVERRIDE
    functions to:
    Foo() override
    
    Then I manually edited:
    * talk/media/webrtc/fakewebrtccommon.h
    * webrtc/test/fake_common.h
    
    Remaining uses of OVERRIDE was fixed by search+replace.
    
    Manual edits were done to fix virtual destructors that were
    overriding inherited ones.
    
    Finally a build error related to the pure virtual definitions of
    Read, Write and Rewind in common_types.h required a bit of
    refactoring in:
    * webrtc/common_types.cc
    * webrtc/common_types.h
    * webrtc/system_wrappers/interface/file_wrapper.h
    * webrtc/system_wrappers/source/file_impl.cc
    
    This roll should make it possible for us to finally re-enable deadlock
    detection for TSan on the buildbots.

    Add RTC_ prefix to (D)CHECKs and related macros.
    
    We must remove dependency on Chromium, i.e. we can't use Chromium's base/logging.h. That means we need to define these macros in WebRTC also when doing Chromium builds. And this causes redefinition.
    
    Alternative solutions:
    * Check if we already have defined e.g. CHECK, and don't define them in that case. This makes us depend on include order in Chromium, which is not acceptable.
    * Don't allow using the macros in WebRTC headers. Error prone since if someone adds it there by mistake it may compile fine, but later break if a header in added or order is changed in Chromium. That will be confusing and hard to enforce.
    * Ensure that headers that are included by an embedder don't include our macros. This would require some heavy refactoring to be maintainable and enforcable.
    * Changes in Chromium for this is obviously not an option.

    Refactor RTCP sender
    
    The main purpose of this CL is to clean up RTCPSender::PrepareRTCP, but
    it has quite a few ramifications. Notable changes:
    
    * Removed the rtcpPacketTypeFlags bit vector and don't assume
      RTCPPacketType values have a single unique bit set. This will allow
      making this an enum class once rtcp_receiver has been overhauled.
    
    * Flags are now stored in a map that is a member of the class. This
      meant we could remove some bool flags (eg send_remb_) which was
      previously masked into rtcpPacketTypeFlags and then masked out again
      when testing if a remb packet should be sent.
    
    * Make all build methods, eg. BuildREMB(), have the same signature.
      An RtcpContext struct was introduced for this purpose. This allowed
      the use of a map from RTCPPacketType to method pointer. Instead of
      18 consecutive if-statements, there is now a single loop.
      The context class also allowed some simplifications in the build
      methods themselves.
    
    * A few minor simplifications and cleanups.
    
    The next step is to gradually replace the builder methods with the
    builders from the new RtcpPacket classes.

    Roll chromium_revision e144d30..6fdb142 (318658:318841) + remove OVERRIDE macro
    
    Clang version changed 223108:230914
    Details: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/e144d30..6fdb142/tools/clang/scripts/update.sh
    
    Removes the OVERRIDE macro defined in:
    * webrtc/base/common.h
    * webrtc/typedefs.h
    
    The majority of the source changes were done by running this in src/:
    perl -0pi -e "s/virtual\s([^({;]*(\([^({;]*\)[^({;]*))(OVERRIDE|override)/\1override/sg" `find {talk,webrtc} -name "*.h"  -o -name "*.cc*" -o -name "*.mm*"`
    
    which converted all:
    virtual Foo() OVERRIDE
    functions to:
    Foo() override
    
    Then I manually edited:
    * talk/media/webrtc/fakewebrtccommon.h
    * webrtc/test/fake_common.h
    
    Remaining uses of OVERRIDE was fixed by search+replace.
    
    Manual edits were done to fix virtual destructors that were
    overriding inherited ones.
    
    Finally a build error related to the pure virtual definitions of
    Read, Write and Rewind in common_types.h required a bit of
    refactoring in:
    * webrtc/common_types.cc
    * webrtc/common_types.h
    * webrtc/system_wrappers/interface/file_wrapper.h
    * webrtc/system_wrappers/source/file_impl.cc
    
    This roll should make it possible for us to finally re-enable deadlock
    detection for TSan on the buildbots.

    Roll chromium_revision e144d30..6fdb142 (318658:318841) + remove OVERRIDE macro
    
    Clang version changed 223108:230914
    Details: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/e144d30..6fdb142/tools/clang/scripts/update.sh
    
    Removes the OVERRIDE macro defined in:
    * webrtc/base/common.h
    * webrtc/typedefs.h
    
    The majority of the source changes were done by running this in src/:
    perl -0pi -e "s/virtual\s([^({;]*(\([^({;]*\)[^({;]*))(OVERRIDE|override)/\1override/sg" `find {talk,webrtc} -name "*.h"  -o -name "*.cc*" -o -name "*.mm*"`
    
    which converted all:
    virtual Foo() OVERRIDE
    functions to:
    Foo() override
    
    Then I manually edited:
    * talk/media/webrtc/fakewebrtccommon.h
    * webrtc/test/fake_common.h
    
    Remaining uses of OVERRIDE was fixed by search+replace.
    
    Manual edits were done to fix virtual destructors that were
    overriding inherited ones.
    
    Finally a build error related to the pure virtual definitions of
    Read, Write and Rewind in common_types.h required a bit of
    refactoring in:
    * webrtc/common_types.cc
    * webrtc/common_types.h
    * webrtc/system_wrappers/interface/file_wrapper.h
    * webrtc/system_wrappers/source/file_impl.cc
    
    This roll should make it possible for us to finally re-enable deadlock
    detection for TSan on the buildbots.

    Use VideoReceiveStream as an ExternalRenderer.
    
    Removes AddRenderCallback from ViERenderer and implements
    VideoReceiveStream on top of DeliverI420Frame like WebRtcVideoEngine
    currently does today.
    
    Also adds ::IsTextureSupported() to the VideoRenderer interface to
    permit querying whether an external renderer supports texture rendering.

    Implement settable min/start/max bitrates in Call.
    
    These parameters are set by the x-google-*-bitrate SDP parameters. This
    is implemented on a Call level instead of per-stream like the currently
    underlying VideoEngine implementation to allow this refactoring to not
    reconfigure the VideoCodec at all but rather adjust bandwidth-estimator
    parameters.
    Also implements SetMaxSendBandwidth in WebRtcVideoEngine2 as it's a SDP
    parameter and allowing it to be dynamically readjusted in Call.

    Split video_render_module implementation into default and internal implementation.
    Targets must now link with implementation of their choice instead of at "gyp"-time.
    
    Targets linking with libjingle_media:
    - internal implementation when build_with_chromium=0, default otherwise.
    
    Targets linking with default render implementation:
    - video_engine_tests
    - video_loopback
    - video_replay
    - anything dependent on webrtc_test_common
    
    Targets linking with internal render implementation:
    - vie_auto_test
    - video_render_tests
    - libwebrtcdemo-jni
    - video_engine_core_unittests
    
    GN changes:
    - Not many since there is almost no test definitions.
    
    Work-around for chromium:
    - Until chromium has updated libpeerconnection to link with video_capture_impl and video_render_impl, webrtc target automatically depends on it. This should fix the FYI bots and not require a webrtc roll to fix.
    
    Re-enable android tests by reverting 7026 (some tests left disabled).
    
    TESTED: passes all the bots. If this inadvertently breaks a target please fix the linking rules so the target has the desired implementation linked in.

    Reserve RTP/RTCP modules in SetSSRC.
    
    Allows setting SSRCs for future simulcast layers even though no set send
    codec uses them.
    
    Also re-enabling CanSwitchToUseAllSsrcs as an end-to-end test, required
    for bitrate ramp-up, instead of send-side only (resolving issue 3078).
    This test was used to verify reserved modules' SSRCs are preserved
    correctly.
    
    To enable a multiple-stream end-to-end test test::CallTest was modified
    to work on a vector of receive streams instead of just one.

    Make VideoSendStream/VideoReceiveStream configs const.
    
    Benefits of this is that the send config previously had unclear locking
    requirements, a lock was used to lock parts parts of it while
    reconfiguring the VideoEncoder. Primary work was splitting out video
    streams from config as well as encoder_settings as these change on
    ReconfigureVideoEncoder. Now threading requirements for both member
    configs are clear (as they are read-only), and encoder_settings doesn't
    stay in the config as a stale pointer.
    
    CreateVideoSendStream now takes video streams separately as well as the
    encoder_settings pointer, analogous to ReconfigureVideoEncoder.
    
    This change required changing so that pacing is silently enabled when
    using suspend_below_min_bitrate rather than silently setting it.

    Replaces VideoCodec in VideoSendStream::Config with an EncoderSettings
    struct. The EncoderSettings struct uses an external encoder for all
    codecs. This means that external users, such as libjingle, will provide
    the encoders themselves, removing the previous distinction of internal
    and external codecs.

    Implement minimum transmit bitrate.
    
    Utilizing minimum transmission bitrate prevents low remote bitrate
    estimates (bitrate estimation dips) when encoding non-complex content
    such as screenshare of a static image even though there's nothing wrong
    with the link.
    
    Requires pacing to be enabled for now, pending issue 3036.

    NetEq4: Changing the behavior of playout_timestamp_ update
    
    The variable playout_timestamp_ was not updated to the latest decoded
    timestamp while comfort noise was played. Instead, it was upadted using
    dead reckoning, which caused it to drift away from the timestamps of the
    incoming CNG packets. Now it is updated also during comfort noise
    playout.
    
    Since the change is only in NetEq4, this change also makes the test
    PlaysOutAudioAndVideoInSync use both ACM1/NetEq3 and ACM2/NetEq4.
    
    Re-enabling one NetEq unit test that is no longer failing thanks to this CL.

    Added support for logging the SSRC corresponding to AudioPlayout events.
    
    To do this, the logging of this event was moved from the ACM to
    VoiceEngine Channel. A new LogAudioPlayoutEvent function was added on
    the RtcEventLog interface, and the LogDebugEvent function was removed
    since it is no longer being used.

    Add RTC_ prefix to (D)CHECKs and related macros.
    
    We must remove dependency on Chromium, i.e. we can't use Chromium's base/logging.h. That means we need to define these macros in WebRTC also when doing Chromium builds. And this causes redefinition.
    
    Alternative solutions:
    * Check if we already have defined e.g. CHECK, and don't define them in that case. This makes us depend on include order in Chromium, which is not acceptable.
    * Don't allow using the macros in WebRTC headers. Error prone since if someone adds it there by mistake it may compile fine, but later break if a header in added or order is changed in Chromium. That will be confusing and hard to enforce.
    * Ensure that headers that are included by an embedder don't include our macros. This would require some heavy refactoring to be maintainable and enforcable.
    * Changes in Chromium for this is obviously not an option.

    Moving the pacer and the pacer thread to ChannelGroup.
    
    This means all channels within the same group will share the same pacing queue and scheduler. It also means padding will be computed and sent by a single pacer. To accomplish this I also introduce a PacketRouter which finds the RTP module which owns the packet to be paced out.

    GN: Disable Chromium clang plugins for standalone build.
    
    Now that WebRTC has rolled the chromium_revision past
    http://crrev.com/284372 in r6784, clang has become the

    yet compile the Chromium Clang plugins enabled, this CL
    disables them for the parts of the code that doesn't yet pass
    compilation with them enabled.
    
    The buildbots are using Goma which is not yet switched
    over to Clang by default. That's why they're not red yet.

    Add RTC_ prefix to (D)CHECKs and related macros.
    
    We must remove dependency on Chromium, i.e. we can't use Chromium's base/logging.h. That means we need to define these macros in WebRTC also when doing Chromium builds. And this causes redefinition.
    
    Alternative solutions:
    * Check if we already have defined e.g. CHECK, and don't define them in that case. This makes us depend on include order in Chromium, which is not acceptable.
    * Don't allow using the macros in WebRTC headers. Error prone since if someone adds it there by mistake it may compile fine, but later break if a header in added or order is changed in Chromium. That will be confusing and hard to enforce.
    * Ensure that headers that are included by an embedder don't include our macros. This would require some heavy refactoring to be maintainable and enforcable.
    * Changes in Chromium for this is obviously not an option.

    For simulcast VideoSendStreams there are more than one entry in the SSRC
    table causing RTCP to currently be delivered more than once per stream.
    This messes up unique NACK stats as all NACK requests sent to such a

    Moving the pacer and the pacer thread to ChannelGroup.
    
    This means all channels within the same group will share the same pacing queue and scheduler. It also means padding will be computed and sent by a single pacer. To accomplish this I also introduce a PacketRouter which finds the RTP module which owns the packet to be paced out.

    Roll chromium_revision e144d30..6fdb142 (318658:318841) + remove OVERRIDE macro
    
    Clang version changed 223108:230914
    Details: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/e144d30..6fdb142/tools/clang/scripts/update.sh
    
    Removes the OVERRIDE macro defined in:
    * webrtc/base/common.h
    * webrtc/typedefs.h
    
    The majority of the source changes were done by running this in src/:
    perl -0pi -e "s/virtual\s([^({;]*(\([^({;]*\)[^({;]*))(OVERRIDE|override)/\1override/sg" `find {talk,webrtc} -name "*.h"  -o -name "*.cc*" -o -name "*.mm*"`
    
    which converted all:
    virtual Foo() OVERRIDE
    functions to:
    Foo() override
    
    Then I manually edited:
    * talk/media/webrtc/fakewebrtccommon.h
    * webrtc/test/fake_common.h
    
    Remaining uses of OVERRIDE was fixed by search+replace.
    
    Manual edits were done to fix virtual destructors that were
    overriding inherited ones.
    
    Finally a build error related to the pure virtual definitions of
    Read, Write and Rewind in common_types.h required a bit of
    refactoring in:
    * webrtc/common_types.cc
    * webrtc/common_types.h
    * webrtc/system_wrappers/interface/file_wrapper.h
    * webrtc/system_wrappers/source/file_impl.cc
    
    This roll should make it possible for us to finally re-enable deadlock
    detection for TSan on the buildbots.

    Implement settable min/start/max bitrates in Call.
    
    These parameters are set by the x-google-*-bitrate SDP parameters. This
    is implemented on a Call level instead of per-stream like the currently
    underlying VideoEngine implementation to allow this refactoring to not
    reconfigure the VideoCodec at all but rather adjust bandwidth-estimator
    parameters.
    Also implements SetMaxSendBandwidth in WebRtcVideoEngine2 as it's a SDP
    parameter and allowing it to be dynamically readjusted in Call.

    Use external VideoDecoders in VideoReceiveStream.
    
    Removes direct VideoCodec use from the new API, exposes VideoDecoders
    through webrtc/video_decoder.h similar to VideoEncoders.
    
    Also includes some preparation for wiring up external decoders in
    WebRtcVideoEngine2 by adding AllocatedDecoders that specify whether they
    were allocated internally or externally.
    
    Additionally addresses a data race in VideoReceiver that was exposed with this change.

    Extract RTP-header SSRC inline in Call.
    
    Prevents unknown-RTP-header-extension warnings to be flooding from the
    RTP-header parsing as there's no way to register RTP extensions for the
    parser in Call as they're allowed to differ between RTP streams.
    
    RTP-header parsing should instead be done separately in every
    VideoReceiveStream.

    Preserve RTP states for restarted VideoSendStreams.
    
    A restarted VideoSendStream would previously be completely reset,
    causing gaps in sequence numbers and potentially RTP timestamps as well.
    This broke SRTP which requires fairly sequential sequence numbers.
    Presumably, were this sent without SRTP, we'd still have problems on the
    receiving end as the corresponding receiver is unaware of this reset.
    
    Also adding annotation to RTPSender and addressing some unlocked
    access to ssrc_, ssrc_rtx_ and rtx_.

    Make VideoSendStream/VideoReceiveStream configs const.
    
    Benefits of this is that the send config previously had unclear locking
    requirements, a lock was used to lock parts parts of it while
    reconfiguring the VideoEncoder. Primary work was splitting out video
    streams from config as well as encoder_settings as these change on
    ReconfigureVideoEncoder. Now threading requirements for both member
    configs are clear (as they are read-only), and encoder_settings doesn't
    stay in the config as a stale pointer.
    
    CreateVideoSendStream now takes video streams separately as well as the
    encoder_settings pointer, analogous to ReconfigureVideoEncoder.
    
    This change required changing so that pacing is silently enabled when
    using suspend_below_min_bitrate rather than silently setting it.

    Remove internal codecs from VideoSendStream.
    
    Replaces VideoCodec in VideoSendStream::Config with an EncoderSettings
    struct. The EncoderSettings struct uses an external encoder for all
    codecs. This means that external users, such as libjingle, will provide
    the encoders themselves, removing the previous distinction of internal
    and external codecs.
    
    For now VideoSendStream translates to VideoCodec internally. In the
    interrim (before the corresponding change is implemented in
    VideoReceiveStream) tests convert EncoderSettings to VideoCodecs.
    
    Removes Call::GetVideoCodecs().
    
    Disables RampUpTest.WithPacingAndRtx as its further exposed with changes
    to bitrates used in tests.

    Set local SSRC for VideoReceiveStream.
    
    As a bonus, also removes GenerateRandomSsrc, which only worked on sender
    configs. There's no point to generate random SSRCs in tests.

    Set up SSRCs correctly after switching codec.
    
    Before SSRCs were not set up correctly, as the old VideoEngine API
    doesn't support setting additional SSRCs before a codec with as many
    streams are set.
    
    No test was in place to catch this, so two tests are added to make sure
    that we send the SSRCs that are set, and also that we can switch from
    using one to using all SSRCs, even though initially not all of them are
    set up.

    Implement VideoSendStream::SetCodec().
    
    Removing assertion that SSRC count should be the same as the number of
    streams in the codec. It makes sense that you don't always use the same
    number of streams under one call. Dropping resolution due to CPU overuse
    for instance can require less streams, but the SSRCs should stay
    allocated so that operations can resume when not overusing any more.
    
    This change also means we can get rid of the ugly SendStreamState whose
    content wasn't defined. Instead we use SetCodec to change resolution
    etc. on the fly. Should something else have to be replaced on the fly
    then that functionality simply has to be implemented.

    Breaking out RTP header parsing from the RTP module.
    
    This is the first step in order to move bandwidth estimation closer to the network. The goal is to have RTP header parsing and bandwidth estimation before voice and video engine, and have a joint estimate for audio and video.
    
    Moving bandwidth estimation before the RTP module is also required for RTX.

    Remove channel ids from various interfaces.
    
    Starts by removing channel/engine id from ViEChannel which propagates
    down to the RTP/RTCP module as well as the transport class.
    
    IncomingVideoStream::RenderFrame() is untouched for now but receives a
    fake id instead of the previous channel id. Added a TODO to remove it
    later but the RenderFrame call is implemented in a lot of
    platform-dependent files and should probably remove the "manager" aspect
    of renderers, so preferring to do it separately

    Roll chromium_revision e144d30..6fdb142 (318658:318841) + remove OVERRIDE macro
    
    Clang version changed 223108:230914
    Details: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/e144d30..6fdb142/tools/clang/scripts/update.sh
    
    Removes the OVERRIDE macro defined in:
    * webrtc/base/common.h
    * webrtc/typedefs.h
    
    The majority of the source changes were done by running this in src/:
    perl -0pi -e "s/virtual\s([^({;]*(\([^({;]*\)[^({;]*))(OVERRIDE|override)/\1override/sg" `find {talk,webrtc} -name "*.h"  -o -name "*.cc*" -o -name "*.mm*"`
    
    which converted all:
    virtual Foo() OVERRIDE
    functions to:
    Foo() override
    
    Then I manually edited:
    * talk/media/webrtc/fakewebrtccommon.h
    * webrtc/test/fake_common.h
    
    Remaining uses of OVERRIDE was fixed by search+replace.
    
    Manual edits were done to fix virtual destructors that were
    overriding inherited ones.
    
    Finally a build error related to the pure virtual definitions of
    Read, Write and Rewind in common_types.h required a bit of
    refactoring in:
    * webrtc/common_types.cc
    * webrtc/common_types.h
    * webrtc/system_wrappers/interface/file_wrapper.h
    * webrtc/system_wrappers/source/file_impl.cc
    
    This roll should make it possible for us to finally re-enable deadlock
    detection for TSan on the buildbots.

    Mark all virtual overrides in the hierarchy of Transport as virtual + OVERRIDE.
    This also marks all virtual overrides of other classes in the same files.
    
    This will make a subsequent change I intend to do safer, where I'll change the
    argument types of the base Transport functions, by breaking the compile if I
    miss any overrides.
    
    This also highlighted a number of unused functions. I've removed some of these.

    Particularly, suppress periodic RTCP packets before
    VideoSendStream.StartSending() or VideoReceiveStream.StartReceiving() have been called, respectively.
    
    RTCP packets are sent periodically, by the Process thread, for every ViE channel even those not sending.

    This allows us to pass packet meta data, such as transport sequence
    number, to libjingle and further down to the socket implementation. A

    Remove channel ids from various interfaces.
    
    Starts by removing channel/engine id from ViEChannel which propagates
    down to the RTP/RTCP module as well as the transport class.
    
    IncomingVideoStream::RenderFrame() is untouched for now but receives a
    fake id instead of the previous channel id. Added a TODO to remove it
    later but the RenderFrame call is implemented in a lot of
    platform-dependent files and should probably remove the "manager" aspect
    of renderers, so preferring to do it separately

    Add RTC_ prefix to (D)CHECKs and related macros.
    
    We must remove dependency on Chromium, i.e. we can't use Chromium's base/logging.h. That means we need to define these macros in WebRTC also when doing Chromium builds. And this causes redefinition.
    
    Alternative solutions:
    * Check if we already have defined e.g. CHECK, and don't define them in that case. This makes us depend on include order in Chromium, which is not acceptable.
    * Don't allow using the macros in WebRTC headers. Error prone since if someone adds it there by mistake it may compile fine, but later break if a header in added or order is changed in Chromium. That will be confusing and hard to enforce.
    * Ensure that headers that are included by an embedder don't include our macros. This would require some heavy refactoring to be maintainable and enforcable.
    * Changes in Chromium for this is obviously not an option.

    GN: Add BUILD.gn files + kjellander to OWNERS
    
    This should work as a foundation for all the work that is
    left to do to make the parts of WebRTC that Chromium uses
    to build with GN.
    
    I implemented some the smaller modules myself in this CL.
    The remaining work (TODO's in the .gn files) will be distributed
    to various team members.
    
    I'm adding myself to OWNERS files for BUILD.gn files in all the
    directories where I'm adding a BUILD.gn file.
    
    BUG=3441
    TEST=
    Successful compilation of WebRTC as standalone:
    gn gen out/Default --args="build_with_chromium=false" && ninja -C out/Default
    gn gen out/Default --args="build_with_chromium=false is_clang=true clang_use_chrome_plugins=false" && ninja -C out/Default
    
    I built successfully from a Chromium checkout (with
    https://codereview.chromium.org/321313006/ applied) using:

    Add RTC_ prefix to (D)CHECKs and related macros.
    
    We must remove dependency on Chromium, i.e. we can't use Chromium's base/logging.h. That means we need to define these macros in WebRTC also when doing Chromium builds. And this causes redefinition.
    
    Alternative solutions:
    * Check if we already have defined e.g. CHECK, and don't define them in that case. This makes us depend on include order in Chromium, which is not acceptable.
    * Don't allow using the macros in WebRTC headers. Error prone since if someone adds it there by mistake it may compile fine, but later break if a header in added or order is changed in Chromium. That will be confusing and hard to enforce.
    * Ensure that headers that are included by an embedder don't include our macros. This would require some heavy refactoring to be maintainable and enforcable.
    * Changes in Chromium for this is obviously not an option.

    Base A/V synchronization on sync_labels.
    
    Groups of streams that should be synchronized are signalled through
    SDP. These should be used rather than synchronizing the first-added
    video stream to the first-added audio stream implicitly.

    Verifies that reduced-size isn't configured in WebRtcVideoEngine2
    without explicit configuration (which doesn't exist). Also disables REMB
    in the default config because it requires reconfiguration.
    
    Adds default-config tests to make sure that they don't contain

    Roll chromium_revision e144d30..6fdb142 (318658:318841) + remove OVERRIDE macro
    
    Clang version changed 223108:230914
    Details: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/e144d30..6fdb142/tools/clang/scripts/update.sh
    
    Removes the OVERRIDE macro defined in:
    * webrtc/base/common.h
    * webrtc/typedefs.h
    
    The majority of the source changes were done by running this in src/:
    perl -0pi -e "s/virtual\s([^({;]*(\([^({;]*\)[^({;]*))(OVERRIDE|override)/\1override/sg" `find {talk,webrtc} -name "*.h"  -o -name "*.cc*" -o -name "*.mm*"`
    
    which converted all:
    virtual Foo() OVERRIDE
    functions to:
    Foo() override
    
    Then I manually edited:
    * talk/media/webrtc/fakewebrtccommon.h
    * webrtc/test/fake_common.h
    
    Remaining uses of OVERRIDE was fixed by search+replace.
    
    Manual edits were done to fix virtual destructors that were
    overriding inherited ones.
    
    Finally a build error related to the pure virtual definitions of
    Read, Write and Rewind in common_types.h required a bit of
    refactoring in:
    * webrtc/common_types.cc
    * webrtc/common_types.h
    * webrtc/system_wrappers/interface/file_wrapper.h
    * webrtc/system_wrappers/source/file_impl.cc
    
    This roll should make it possible for us to finally re-enable deadlock
    detection for TSan on the buildbots.

    Use external VideoDecoders in VideoReceiveStream.
    
    Removes direct VideoCodec use from the new API, exposes VideoDecoders
    through webrtc/video_decoder.h similar to VideoEncoders.
    
    Also includes some preparation for wiring up external decoders in
    WebRtcVideoEngine2 by adding AllocatedDecoders that specify whether they
    were allocated internally or externally.
    
    Additionally addresses a data race in VideoReceiver that was exposed with this change.

    Split video_render_module implementation into default and internal implementation.
    Targets must now link with implementation of their choice instead of at "gyp"-time.
    
    Targets linking with libjingle_media:
    - internal implementation when build_with_chromium=0, default otherwise.
    
    Targets linking with default render implementation:
    - video_engine_tests
    - video_loopback
    - video_replay
    - anything dependent on webrtc_test_common
    
    Targets linking with internal render implementation:
    - vie_auto_test
    - video_render_tests
    - libwebrtcdemo-jni
    - video_engine_core_unittests
    
    GN changes:
    - Not many since there is almost no test definitions.
    
    Work-around for chromium:
    - Until chromium has updated libpeerconnection to link with video_capture_impl and video_render_impl, webrtc target automatically depends on it. This should fix the FYI bots and not require a webrtc roll to fix.
    
    Re-enable android tests by reverting 7026 (some tests left disabled).
    
    TESTED: passes all the bots. If this inadvertently breaks a target please fix the linking rules so the target has the desired implementation linked in.

    Refactor Call-based tests.
    
    Greatly reduces duplication of constants and setup code for tests based
    on the new webrtc::Call APIs. It also makes it significantly easier to
    convert sender-only to end-to-end tests as they share more code.

    Make VideoSendStream/VideoReceiveStream configs const.
    
    Benefits of this is that the send config previously had unclear locking
    requirements, a lock was used to lock parts parts of it while
    reconfiguring the VideoEncoder. Primary work was splitting out video
    streams from config as well as encoder_settings as these change on
    ReconfigureVideoEncoder. Now threading requirements for both member
    configs are clear (as they are read-only), and encoder_settings doesn't
    stay in the config as a stale pointer.
    
    CreateVideoSendStream now takes video streams separately as well as the
    encoder_settings pointer, analogous to ReconfigureVideoEncoder.
    
    This change required changing so that pacing is silently enabled when
    using suspend_below_min_bitrate rather than silently setting it.

    Remove TraceCallback use from Call.
    
    Non-global logging isn't supported, and having a per-call logging
    dispatch seems over-eager and adds more complexity than it's worth. The
    current implementation is racy on initialization due to missing atomics
    support. Besides, logging support should be separate from use of Call.

    Remove internal codecs from VideoSendStream.
    
    Replaces VideoCodec in VideoSendStream::Config with an EncoderSettings
    struct. The EncoderSettings struct uses an external encoder for all
    codecs. This means that external users, such as libjingle, will provide
    the encoders themselves, removing the previous distinction of internal
    and external codecs.
    
    For now VideoSendStream translates to VideoCodec internally. In the
    interrim (before the corresponding change is implemented in
    VideoReceiveStream) tests convert EncoderSettings to VideoCodecs.
    
    Removes Call::GetVideoCodecs().
    
    Disables RampUpTest.WithPacingAndRtx as its further exposed with changes
    to bitrates used in tests.

    To do this, the logging of this event was moved from the ACM to
    VoiceEngine Channel. A new LogAudioPlayoutEvent function was added on
    the RtcEventLog interface, and the LogDebugEvent function was removed
    since it is no longer being used.

    Add RTC_ prefix to (D)CHECKs and related macros.
    
    We must remove dependency on Chromium, i.e. we can't use Chromium's base/logging.h. That means we need to define these macros in WebRTC also when doing Chromium builds. And this causes redefinition.
    
    Alternative solutions:
    * Check if we already have defined e.g. CHECK, and don't define them in that case. This makes us depend on include order in Chromium, which is not acceptable.
    * Don't allow using the macros in WebRTC headers. Error prone since if someone adds it there by mistake it may compile fine, but later break if a header in added or order is changed in Chromium. That will be confusing and hard to enforce.
    * Ensure that headers that are included by an embedder don't include our macros. This would require some heavy refactoring to be maintainable and enforcable.
    * Changes in Chromium for this is obviously not an option.

    Moving the pacer and the pacer thread to ChannelGroup.
    
    This means all channels within the same group will share the same pacing queue and scheduler. It also means padding will be computed and sent by a single pacer. To accomplish this I also introduce a PacketRouter which finds the RTP module which owns the packet to be paced out.

    GN: Disable Chromium clang plugins for standalone build.
    
    Now that WebRTC has rolled the chromium_revision past
    http://crrev.com/284372 in r6784, clang has become the

    disables them for the parts of the code that doesn't yet pass
    compilation with them enabled.

    Add RTC_ prefix to (D)CHECKs and related macros.
    
    We must remove dependency on Chromium, i.e. we can't use Chromium's base/logging.h. That means we need to define these macros in WebRTC also when doing Chromium builds. And this causes redefinition.
    
    Alternative solutions:
    * Check if we already have defined e.g. CHECK, and don't define them in that case. This makes us depend on include order in Chromium, which is not acceptable.
    * Don't allow using the macros in WebRTC headers. Error prone since if someone adds it there by mistake it may compile fine, but later break if a header in added or order is changed in Chromium. That will be confusing and hard to enforce.
    * Ensure that headers that are included by an embedder don't include our macros. This would require some heavy refactoring to be maintainable and enforcable.
    * Changes in Chromium for this is obviously not an option.

    We must remove dependency on Chromium, i.e. we can't use Chromium's base/logging.h. That means we need to define these macros in WebRTC also when doing Chromium builds. And this causes redefinition.

    GN: Add BUILD.gn files + kjellander to OWNERS
    
    This should work as a foundation for all the work that is
    left to do to make the parts of WebRTC that Chromium uses
    to build with GN.
    
    I implemented some the smaller modules myself in this CL.
    The remaining work (TODO's in the .gn files) will be distributed
    to various team members.
    
    I'm adding myself to OWNERS files for BUILD.gn files in all the
    directories where I'm adding a BUILD.gn file.
    
    BUG=3441

    Successful compilation of WebRTC as standalone:
    gn gen out/Default --args="build_with_chromium=false" && ninja -C out/Default
    gn gen out/Default --args="build_with_chromium=false is_clang=true clang_use_chrome_plugins=false" && ninja -C out/Default

    Add RTC_ prefix to contructormagic macros.
    
    We must remove dependency on Chromium, i.e. we can't use Chromium's base/logging.h. That means we need to define these macros in WebRTC also when doing Chromium builds. And this causes redefinition.
