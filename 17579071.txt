    bug fix
    Added stuff
    
    Adding page centering so when you zoom way out it will center it. (Give
    it a try)
    Adding hovering function for professors. (still waiting for these to get
    added to database)
    Added a button to go home. I experimented with there styleing, but i
    dont think it is gonna work so i am adding the navigation in.
    Change javascript so that "save" works when directed off a controller.
    This is how it will function in the actual app. So just keep in mind if
    you load AdvisingView as the default controller, "save" will fail.
    Added Stuff
    
    You should now recieve all the data you need to save.  Take a look at
    the save function in the controller. It gives you the data as a json.
    
    Add course and click "save" and the code will run. It looks a little
    messy atm, and i am not sure why that is.
    
    All that is left for the save part is for you to finish up the
    controller stuff.
    
    I also need the information that was previously saved to load by default
    So youll have to let me know when this gets done. Feel free to message
    me with questions
    javascript changes
    
    Fixed layout issues, now should scroll on all screens in smaller
    windows.
    Added "select subject" so that they can navigate through course like a
    BOSS. (cause its from boss X_x) Also fixed some formatting stuff with
    this.
    Got ajax to communicate with php controller function "save".
    Added storing of callnum, ids, and type to javascript to populate the
    data sending to the controller.
    
    WIP: Now i need to integrate the data gathered with ajax (get ajax to
    send callNums and types)
    More Updates
    
    Got Course Title displayed again. I dont understand why someone
    commented all these out.
    I change course titles to a hover function. (this is experimental) It
    removes clutter, but lessens the overall helpfulness. I may switch hours
    and add back titles.
    Reset button is fuctional now.
    I am still working on save, its really complicated.
    Working on making to whole page scrollable as well.

    dont think it is gonna work so i am adding the navigation in.
    Change javascript so that "save" works when directed off a controller.

    the save function in the controller. It gives you the data as a json.
    
    Add course and click "save" and the code will run. It looks a little
    messy atm, and i am not sure why that is.
    
    All that is left for the save part is for you to finish up the

    We just have to make the "student_courses_form" view more legible. At
    this point the number of classes pushes the submit button below the

    Most of the changes here are for navigation.
    You now should log in as a student or advisor for testing from now on.
    1. Changes routes to default to 'Login'
    2. Uncommented session and commented out the static student id in the
    advisingform controller.

    have to add the students which should get passed in with SID's from our
    controller.
