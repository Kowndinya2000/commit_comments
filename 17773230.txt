    - Needed -- for piping to PHP
    - Omitted a "-" in front of "-repository-url"
    [#105] Updated to provide additional download methods
    suggest "create-project" when using compoer
    
    this requires first registering this repository on packagist.org
    Update index.php and Application\Module to make composer use optional
    
    - index.php now supports ZF2_PATH env var or git submodule
    - re-add the git submodule to make non-composer install easier
    - update the readme
    - use include instead of include_once, see:
    http://robert.accettura.com/blog/2011/06/11/phps-include_once-is-insanely-expensive/
    
    If you are not using composer, you no longer have to make changes to the default
    skeleton.
    Update readme to not include classmap autoloader registration.
    
    Since we no longer include the classmap file.
    Updated README to add a Virtual Host section to installation.
    Further clarified README.md with autoloader additions to Module.php

    - moved library/ZendFramework to vendor/ZendFramework, got rid of library/
    - updated zf2 submodule
    - added config/autoload path with readme explaining the purpose
    - set up to glob for config/autoload/*.config.php
    Add vendors/ directory for third-party modules
    
    - The odd-looking .gitignore is so that the README file is included in the
    repository, but if the user installs some third part modules, they won't
    accidentally be added to the skeleton git repository. We do the same thing in
    the modules/ directory.
    - Added readme explaining that vendors/ is for third-party modules

    Fixes to enable and enforce SharedEventManager instance
    
    - Instead of using StaticEventManager, pull shared collection for event manager
      in module manager
    - Instantiate and injected SharedEventManager in index.php (we can refine and
      abstract this later)
    Moving Url and Doctype view helpers setup to module configuration. Also, adding various comments on the configuration to make it more explicit as it importance increases
    Removed obsolete lines.

    - Updated configuration to utilize new view layer
    - Updated controllers to return View Models
    - Updated Application\Module to only configure necessary view helpers

    Using getBasePath() instead of getBaseUrl() to detect basePath.
    Move some of the view related code from the Module class to the layout view script
    Set doctype as HTML5
    Use getBaseUrl() instead of detectBaseUrl()
    
    Pointed out by @Swaagie, detectBaseUrl() doesn't cache to a class property per
    request, whereas getBaseUrl() is a wrapper for detectBaseUrl() which does cache
    per instance of the request.

    - index.php updated to new module manager interface
    Remove $env parameter from initAutoloader method
    Updated for ZF changeges
    
    - Module::getConfig() now returns a simple array, not a config object
    - View listener returns a PhpEnvironment\Response (sendable) upon error
    Various clean up
    
    - config returns array which index.php converts to zend\config\config
    - Application module initAutoloader improved
    - Application classmap updated

    update to jquery to fix #110
    Update module/Application/view/layout/layout.phtml
    
    Changed 2 spaces to 4.
    Use long tags with echo statement
    Add inlineScript() helper
    
    For faster DOM parsing it is recommended to place some scripts just above
    the </body> tag. Rendering the inlineScript() helper here makes it possible
    to inject files in both the <head> and at the end of the <body>
    Prepend scripts in layout
    
    When view scripts append scripts based on jQuery, they are registered last
    so jQuery is already loaded.
    Prepend styles in layout
    
    When view scripts append styles for the headLink() helper, those are now
    really registered last.
    Add missing echo to translation in layout
    Translate text in layout
    Add jquery to layout by default
    
    I'm not 100% sold on shipping this with the skeleton, as it's one more
    thing people have to remove if they're not using it. However, it's
    required to make the responsive layout work properly and having it
    included makes ZendDeveloperTools work with the skeleton out of the box,
    which is a plus.
    Clean up layout and configs
    
    - Layout helpers used inline instead of in code block at the top of the
      layout.
    - Removed unnecessary config keys
    Fixed copyright year in footer.
    conditional include of html5 shim
    Add viewport meta tag for smart phone scaling
    
    This somehow got removed.
    Remove date('Y') call in layout
    
    Replaced with static year. For some reason the date() function in PHP is
    shockingly slow (3+ms on an i5) which is like 8% of the runtime in an optimized
    benchmark.
    Remove usage of raw() view helper in layout
    Add viewport meta tag for smart phone scaling
    Update button styles and switched to "ZF green"
    Update layout to use Twitter Bootstrap 2.0.0
    Move some of the view related code from the Module class to the layout view script
    Moved javascript down, after css. Best practice.
    Rename "views" and "layouts" to singular form.
    
    Directory names should be in singular form whenever possible.

    - Removed the default route, as it is not recommended.
    - See https://github.com/zendframework/ZendSkeletonModule/pull/3 for how
      a module-specific default route can be created.

    Moved the RouteStack di class definition into the module config.
    
    The definition originally was in Mvc\Bootstrap::setLocator.
    
    It would be better to leave the definition in Bootstrap, and simply set
    a "preference" value in the config, but the definition *appears* to
    override the preference settings.
    [#1] Added AggregateResolver
    
    - Updated ZF2 to rev db6a6e3
    - Modified configuration to use AggregateResolver
    Fixes for helper loader/broker configuration
    
    - Removed unneeded aliases
    - Removed obsolete classmap entries
    - Updated ZF2 library to latest feature/view-layer
    Updated configuration to follow view-layer
    
    - names of templates should not include file suffix
    - corrected parameter names for exception, no route strategies
    Simplified TemplatePathStack config
    
    - Since bootstrap now contains configuration for template path stack,
      can simply path "paths" parameter
    Working view layer integration
    
    - Updated ZF submodule to c85c45a4 of weierophinney/feature/view-layer
    - Updated configuration to utilize new view layer
    - Updated controllers to return View Models
    - Updated Application\Module to only configure necessary view helpers
    - Removed Application\View\Listener; no longer necessary
    Fixing configuration according with changes done to router initializationThis change just moves router configuration to instance configuration of the router itself. The change is necessary to allow the router to be injected into other instances of the DiC and to eventually switch the router type to a custom one with own dependencies and eventually completely unaware of the default Zend\Mvc\Router\Http\TreeRouteStack. These changes are related to https://github.com/Ocramius/zf2/compare/zendframework%3Amaster...mvc-router-from-locator
    Inject the plugin loader into Zend\Mvc\Controller\PluginBroker by default to simplify injecting controller plugins
    Inject the PluginBroker into the ActionController so that we pick up any module's controller plugins that they have injected into it. By injecting into ActionController, all controllers that extend it will automatically pick up this injection without having to inject themselves which of course saves a lot of typing for developers and stops them wondering why a given plugin isn't working in a particular controller\!
    Rename "views" and "layouts" to singular form.

    - Remove custom URL helper, using ZF-proivded one now
    Update zf2 submoudle and Di configuration
    
    - Per updates to zf2 master, no need to explicitly disable annotations in the
    runtime configuration for DI
    Update for new Zend\Di and Zend\Code stuff
    
    - Change ZF2 submodule to use git.zendframework.com to keep up to date better

    Zend\Di and Zend\Code changes

    Use alias rule always
    
    - I tested using the new RewriteCond and RewriteRule that were in the comments
      on my previous commit against a non-aliased host - and they work perfectly in
      that environment. As such, this is actually a better solution, as it will work
      in all cases.
    - Documented the reasons for the rule in the file.
    Document rewrite rules for PaaS solutions
    
    - Added documentation for additional .htaccess lines you may need when
      on some PaaS platforms that use Apache Alias directives (phpcloud,
      OpenShift, others).

    issue raised and discussed by zomg in IRC.
    Update Skeleton to ZF2 RC1.
    
    - updated zf2 submodule.
    - removed ->send() from index.php because it has been deprecated (more info: https://github.com/Thinkscape/zf2/commit/37747bd608d9b75dc340c4ff8b991ff3706dd4de)
    Clean up index.php significantly
    ensure we register the Zend namespace for the StandardAutoloader
    Update index.php and Application\Module to make composer use optional
    
    - index.php now supports ZF2_PATH env var or git submodule
    - re-add the git submodule to make non-composer install easier
    - update the readme
    - use include instead of include_once, see:
    http://robert.accettura.com/blog/2011/06/11/phps-include_once-is-insanely-expensive/
    
    If you are not using composer, you no longer have to make changes to the default

    Fixes to enable and enforce SharedEventManager instance
    
    - Instead of using StaticEventManager, pull shared collection for event manager
      in module manager
    - Instantiate and injected SharedEventManager in index.php (we can refine and
      abstract this later)
    Update glob() for autoload config files
    
    Per a discussion on IRC with @weierophinney:
    
    - requiring ".config" in the filenames is redundant as they live under the
    config/ tree
    - "local" and "global" should be optional
    
    This leaves us with simply config/autoload/*.php.
    Add optional config filename prefix
    Reverting to config globbing practice decided in meeting
    
    See http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV2/2011-12-07+Meeting+Log
    added glob path for modules dropin configs, added pattern for gitignored local.config.php
    so it will always load regardless of env settings.

    Updated to use Zend\Mvc\Bootstrap
    
    - Moved view initialization to Application\Module
      - combined view initialization and view listener registration into a single
        event listener
    Updates and cleanup

      - Accept ModuleManager as sole constructor argument, and pull merged
        configuration from it
    - index.php:
      - Do not use object notation for accessing config values; use array
        notation. Allows flexibility in how application configuration is
        returned
