    [FIX] Some xml tags changed to html tags
    [CHANGE] Link checker is now more flexible. And btw, its a long time since I committed!
    [FIX] Fixed link checker problems (was just loading without returning anything)
    [FEATURE] About 50% of inline CSS rules removed from individual files, instead using css classes, hopefully making template creation easier. Also trying to replace tab images with CSS classes (so even images can be replaced by css), not yet finished.
    I have done most translations already, a few still remain. The template structure is nearly there, will still tweak it a little.

    [FEATURE] Update site_checker.php also accounts.php based on new update
    [SECURITY] WARNING: Bug found due to the insert_location() function (download system) which reveals premium cookies and base_64 encoded auth-strings to end user(s). The premium accounts of rapidleech servers providing premium-account downloads to public, are in danger of having their premium accounts compromised! Private rapidleech servers are safe for now, but are strongly encouraged to upgrade
    [SECURITY] Standard auth system for premium accounts is put in place, any premium plugins not adhering to the new standard will either be compromised, or won't work with the new system. Premium account data using base64 authorisation are no longer passed via the insert_location function, instead they are retrieved internally
    [SECURITY] New premium cookie encryption system implemented (due to the complexity of cookie system and to keep load on 3rd-party servers to a minimum, cookies are encrypted instead, and then decrypted when needed)
    [SECURITY] New $secretkey in accounts.php, which is used for cookie encryption. A standard key is included, but you must create your own random string, max 56 characters in length
    [SECURITY] Rapidshare, Hotfile, Megaupload, Netload premium system updated. Other filehost premium plugins will need to be updated, if needed (this includes paid-for plugins also)

    [SECURITY] WARNING: Bug found due to the insert_location() function (download system) which reveals premium cookies and base_64 encoded auth-strings to end user(s). The premium accounts of rapidleech servers providing premium-account downloads to public, are in danger of having their premium accounts compromised! Private rapidleech servers are safe for now, but are strongly encouraged to upgrade
    [SECURITY] Standard auth system for premium accounts is put in place, any premium plugins not adhering to the new standard will either be compromised, or won't work with the new system. Premium account data using base64 authorisation are no longer passed via the insert_location function, instead they are retrieved internally
    [SECURITY] New premium cookie encryption system implemented (due to the complexity of cookie system and to keep load on 3rd-party servers to a minimum, cookies are encrypted instead, and then decrypted when needed)
    [SECURITY] New $secretkey in accounts.php, which is used for cookie encryption. A standard key is included, but you must create your own random string, max 56 characters in length
    [SECURITY] Rapidshare, Hotfile, Megaupload, Netload premium system updated. Other filehost premium plugins will need to be updated, if needed (this includes paid-for plugins also)

    [SECURITY] WARNING: Bug found due to the insert_location() function (download system) which reveals premium cookies and base_64 encoded auth-strings to end user(s). The premium accounts of rapidleech servers providing premium-account downloads to public, are in danger of having their premium accounts compromised! Private rapidleech servers are safe for now, but are strongly encouraged to upgrade
    [SECURITY] Standard auth system for premium accounts is put in place, any premium plugins not adhering to the new standard will either be compromised, or won't work with the new system. Premium account data using base64 authorisation are no longer passed via the insert_location function, instead they are retrieved internally
    [SECURITY] New premium cookie encryption system implemented (due to the complexity of cookie system and to keep load on 3rd-party servers to a minimum, cookies are encrypted instead, and then decrypted when needed)
    [SECURITY] New $secretkey in accounts.php, which is used for cookie encryption. A standard key is included, but you must create your own random string, max 56 characters in length
    [SECURITY] Rapidshare, Hotfile, Megaupload, Netload premium system updated. Other filehost premium plugins will need to be updated, if needed (this includes paid-for plugins also)

    [FIX] Rapidshare multi-account authorisation will be encrypted now
    [FIX] $secretkey set to empty by default, now if you attempt to use premium service without setting $secretkey you will be warned until you set a random value
    [SECURITY] WARNING: Bug found due to the insert_location() function (download system) which reveals premium cookies and base_64 encoded auth-strings to end user(s). The premium accounts of rapidleech servers providing premium-account downloads to public, are in danger of having their premium accounts compromised! Private rapidleech servers are safe for now, but are strongly encouraged to upgrade
    [SECURITY] Standard auth system for premium accounts is put in place, any premium plugins not adhering to the new standard will either be compromised, or won't work with the new system. Premium account data using base64 authorisation are no longer passed via the insert_location function, instead they are retrieved internally
    [SECURITY] New premium cookie encryption system implemented (due to the complexity of cookie system and to keep load on 3rd-party servers to a minimum, cookies are encrypted instead, and then decrypted when needed)
    [SECURITY] New $secretkey in accounts.php, which is used for cookie encryption. A standard key is included, but you must create your own random string, max 56 characters in length
    [SECURITY] Rapidshare, Hotfile, Megaupload, Netload premium system updated. Other filehost premium plugins will need to be updated, if needed (this includes paid-for plugins also)
