    Bumped Android Build Tools version to 22.0.1...
    
    Versions 22.0.0 and 22.0.1 were both released in the March 2015, and
    from the [release notes]
    (https://developer.android.com/tools/revisions/build-tools.html), it
    appears that 22.0.1 fixes a bug.  Furthermore, 22.0.0 is not readily
    available in the Android SDK Manager tools.  22.0.1 should be more
    robust and easier to use.
    Fixed isLookingAt method
