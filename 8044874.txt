    Parametrize logging in riak.conf
    Fix execution for Riak KV - both on Travis CI and locally
    
    Issue appears to be subtle change in probably undefined behaviour of
    Ansible from in 2.2.2.0 as compared to 2.2.1.0.  Last CI successful
    build and current CI failing build have this Ansible version
    difference.  And locally I recently upgraded Ansible and shortly
    afterwards I noticed issue too.
    
    Change is based on:
