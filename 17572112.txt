    Updates:
    
    Added feedback from @ginty to PR with one exception: as I writing the docs, I found myself using the word <code>global</code> often and it was starting to lose meaning. Additionally, I ended up using <code>universal install</code>, to refer to the actual IT-managed installation (like what we have in NXP) so then universal vs. global install was getting convoluted. So, since the global install is really geared towards being used in a TR (tool-repository) package, I renamed <code>global</code> to <code>tool_repo</code>. I.e., <code>global_install_dir</code> to <code>tool_repo_install_dir</code>. I can change it back to <code>global</code> though, but I think it helped the docs flow better and not use <code>global</code> to mean few different things.
    
    Updated docs. I added a new page to the 'getting started' section about invocations, updated the plugin creation guide to discuss sharing global commands, and added an 'advanced topics' section to talk about the different installation options using the site config. I put this in a new section since I think it's out of the scope of just 'getting started' but also kind of an off-the-wall feature that may just clutter up the 'misc' section. I can move it though if needed.
    
    Small fix to the 'fix_my_workspace' script since it always wanted to use the universal install.
    
    Added application options to global commands since I forgot about this last time.
    
    I found that if a YAML file exists but is empty of any parameters, the load will 'succeed' but the results is nil. I.e., an empty site config add the value 'nil' into the site-configs arrray, causing Ruby to explode. Added fix for this.
    
    Made some changes to the site config to give <code>gem_install_dir</code> and <code>user_install_dir</code> some dynamic default values without needing to evaluate anything from the site config.
    Initial attempt at global origen commands.
    Update origen_site_config.yml

    Lint cleanup
    Fixed bin file
    Fix for #42 and various other minor improvements
    removed puts statements
    Comments added
    Bugfix -- fixes Origen Initialization
    Bumped hard dependency on nokogiri to the latest version
    Patch to enable regressions vs. NXP RGen v2
    Fix regression command test case
    Removed the following legacy code/features:
    
    * Origen::NVM module, no replacement
    * Origen::Tester module (J750, UltraFLEX, V93K, Doc), replaced by
      OrigenTesters plugin
    * Origen::Tester::JLink, replaced by OrigenDebuggers plugin
    * Origen::Tester::BDM, no replacement
    * Origen::Utility::DesignSync, replaced by
      Origen::RevisionControl::DesignSync
    * Partially removed the legacy imports system, this will be fully
      removed in a future update (replaced by Ruby gems/bundler)
    Fixed issue with exit status not being set to 1 upon failing commands
    Capture the launch pwd to make Origen.site_config behave correctly if the pwd is later changed
    * Some general controller improvements and additional test coverage. * The failing stacktrace shown in the console now only shows callers from within the current   application. Previous behavior that would show the complete trace (including calls in plugins   and Origen core) can be restored by running with --verbose. * A proc can now be assigned as a target to use some custom code rather than a target file, this   is mainly intended to used within tests:  ~~~ruby Origen.target.temporary = -> {  = SomeLocalClass.new }  # Any calls to load or reload the target will now execute the above function ~~~

    from the 'origen pl' command, these might be reintroduced in the future.
    Sync to v2.5.0.pre134
    
    Some improvements to the Spec API:
    
    - $dut.spec can now be used as an alias for $dut.specs when looking up specs.
    - Made spec objects a little nicer to work with in the console and made the output more consistent with other APIs like the Register API. This update has removed the :verbose option that was supported by some APIs, its implementation was a bit confusing.
    - For now multiple specs are shown in the console as an array of names, and single specs are shown as a table. A future enhancement can be made in the future to view multiple specs in tabular form if required.
    - Added a test to clarify how fuzzy spec finding works, but no changes have been made at this time.

    Added some cases to check if the 'app' is the Origen module and update files and paths accordingly.
    
    Added a 'private' accessor that will make the session file only read/writable by the user. Permissions: 600. Default is 664. This is available for any session, global or application. Added .private? method as well to check if this is set.

    Completed some automatic setup for workspace paths. Added some dynamic site config methods. Updated docs and specs accordingly.
    Updates:
    
    Added feedback from @ginty to PR with one exception: as I writing the docs, I found myself using the word <code>global</code> often and it was starting to lose meaning. Additionally, I ended up using <code>universal install</code>, to refer to the actual IT-managed installation (like what we have in NXP) so then universal vs. global install was getting convoluted. So, since the global install is really geared towards being used in a TR (tool-repository) package, I renamed <code>global</code> to <code>tool_repo</code>. I.e., <code>global_install_dir</code> to <code>tool_repo_install_dir</code>. I can change it back to <code>global</code> though, but I think it helped the docs flow better and not use <code>global</code> to mean few different things.
    
    Updated docs. I added a new page to the 'getting started' section about invocations, updated the plugin creation guide to discuss sharing global commands, and added an 'advanced topics' section to talk about the different installation options using the site config. I put this in a new section since I think it's out of the scope of just 'getting started' but also kind of an off-the-wall feature that may just clutter up the 'misc' section. I can move it though if needed.
    
    Small fix to the 'fix_my_workspace' script since it always wanted to use the universal install.
    
    Added application options to global commands since I forgot about this last time.
    
    I found that if a YAML file exists but is empty of any parameters, the load will 'succeed' but the results is nil. I.e., an empty site config add the value 'nil' into the site-configs arrray, causing Ruby to explode. Added fix for this.
    
    Made some changes to the site config to give <code>gem_install_dir</code> and <code>user_install_dir</code> some dynamic default values without needing to evaluate anything from the site config.

So, since the global install is really geared towards being used in a TR (tool-repository) package, I renamed <code>global</code> to <code>tool_repo</code>. I.e., <code>global_install_dir</code> to <code>tool_repo_install_dir</code>. I can change it back to <code>global</code> though, but I think it helped the docs flow better and not use <code>global</code> to mean few different things.
    
    Updated docs. I added a new page to the 'getting started' section about invocations, updated the plugin creation guide to discuss sharing global commands, and added an 'advanced topics' section to talk about the different installation options using the site config. I put this in a new section since I think it's out of the scope of just 'getting started' but also kind of an off-the-wall feature that may just clutter up the 'misc' section. I can move it though if needed.
    
    Small fix to the 'fix_my_workspace' script since it always wanted to use the universal install.
    
    Added application options to global commands since I forgot about this last time.
    
    I found that if a YAML file exists but is empty of any parameters, the load will 'succeed' but the results is nil. I.e., an empty site config add the value 'nil' into the site-configs arrray, causing Ruby to explode. Added fix for this.

    Updates:
    
    Added feedback from @ginty to PR with one exception: as I writing the docs, I found myself using the word <code>global</code> often and it was starting to lose meaning. Additionally, I ended up using <code>universal install</code>, to refer to the actual IT-managed installation (like what we have in NXP) so then universal vs. global install was getting convoluted. So, since the global install is really geared towards being used in a TR (tool-repository) package, I renamed <code>global</code> to <code>tool_repo</code>. I.e., <code>global_install_dir</code> to <code>tool_repo_install_dir</code>. I can change it back to <code>global</code> though, but I think it helped the docs flow better and not use <code>global</code> to mean few different things.
    
    Updated docs. I added a new page to the 'getting started' section about invocations, updated the plugin creation guide to discuss sharing global commands, and added an 'advanced topics' section to talk about the different installation options using the site config. I put this in a new section since I think it's out of the scope of just 'getting started' but also kind of an off-the-wall feature that may just clutter up the 'misc' section. I can move it though if needed.
    
    Small fix to the 'fix_my_workspace' script since it always wanted to use the universal install.
    
    Added application options to global commands since I forgot about this last time.
    
    I found that if a YAML file exists but is empty of any parameters, the load will 'succeed' but the results is nil. I.e., an empty site config add the value 'nil' into the site-configs arrray, causing Ruby to explode. Added fix for this.
    
    Made some changes to the site config to give <code>gem_install_dir</code> and <code>user_install_dir</code> some dynamic default values without needing to evaluate anything from the site config.
    Added global LSF for LSF access when Origen is running globally. Required to run some plugins globally.
    Clean up for lint. Specs passing now.
    Added support for a global Origen session, from the user's perspective, that is stored at ~/.origen/.session. This behaves the same as the application session but is accessible between Origen workspaces.
    
    Added method Origen.home to point to ~/.origen. Actual implementation uses Ruby's Dir.home.
    
    Added some cases to check if the 'app' is the Origen module and update files and paths accordingly.
    
    Added a 'private' accessor that will make the session file only read/writable by the user. Permissions: 600. Default is 664. This is available for any session, global or application. Added .private? method as well to check if this is set.
    
    Changed around the return strings if the 'app' is Origen. Reads as 'Origen's Global Session'.
    
    Update session.md.erb accordingly.
    Fixed bug with instantiating permanent callback handlers, can now happen before app load
    Added Origen.with_user(user_obj) and changed Origen.current_user to use switch_user if switch_user is not nil.
    Patch to add top level root to load path
    Passed the app instance into all after_app_loaded callbacks
    Added Origen.after_app_loaded
    Added API for plugins to add additional configuration attributes
    Remove binding.pry again
    Remove binding.pry
    Add simple errata spec file that tests whether errata objects can be created
    Add autoload Errata to origen.rb
    Various bug fixes and minor enhancements
    Instantiate an empty test program interface if none defined
    Added scan register model, ports can now be driven
    Working on conversion to a bit-level netlist
    Added initial API to connect ports to other ports in a netlist
    Added initial Port API
    Lint cleanup
    Added misc guides
    Removed more legacy code. Added mode command to allow the mode to be set
    at workspace level similar to the target and the environment, e.g.
    'origen m debug'
    Added a guard to prevent origen loading when FSL RGen is present
    Removed deprecated code
    Removed all of the legacy import system and added improved API for
    working with plugins.
    Some legacy APIs have been deprecated. Removed most of the sub-commands
    from the 'origen pl' command, these might be reintroduced in the future.
    Removed the following legacy code/features:
    
    * Origen::NVM module, no replacement
    * Origen::Tester module (J750, UltraFLEX, V93K, Doc), replaced by
      OrigenTesters plugin
    * Origen::Tester::JLink, replaced by OrigenDebuggers plugin
    * Origen::Tester::BDM, no replacement
    * Origen::Utility::DesignSync, replaced by
      Origen::RevisionControl::DesignSync
    * Partially removed the legacy imports system, this will be fully
      removed in a future update (replaced by Ruby gems/bundler)
    config/environment.rb is now called config/boot.rb, config/development.rb is redundant
    Capture the launch pwd to make Origen.site_config behave correctly if the pwd is later changed
    * Some general controller improvements and additional test coverage. * The failing stacktrace shown in the console now only shows callers from within the current   application. Previous behavior that would show the complete trace (including calls in plugins   and Origen core) can be restored by running with --verbose. * A proc can now be assigned as a target to use some custom code rather than a target file, this   is mainly intended to used within tests:  ~~~ruby Origen.target.temporary = -> {  = SomeLocalClass.new }  # Any calls to load or reload the target will now execute the above function ~~~
    Lint fix
    Sync to v2.5.0.pre144

    Some improvements to the Spec API:
    
    - $dut.spec can now be used as an alias for $dut.specs when looking up specs.
    - Made spec objects a little nicer to work with in the console and made the output more consistent with other APIs like the Register API. This update has removed the :verbose option that was supported by some APIs, its implementation was a bit confusing.
    - For now multiple specs are shown in the console as an array of names, and single specs are shown as a table. A future enhancement can be made in the future to view multiple specs in tabular form if required.
    - Added a test to clarify how fuzzy spec finding works, but no changes have been made at this time.

    Removed the format check on the version to compare against in the regression command. If your app uses Git, this means you can also enter a commit hash or branch ID to specify the reference version to compare against.
    
    Improved differ (Origen::Utility::Diff), this will now correctly ignore end of line comments and not just the full line comments.
    Added better error checking for when plugins overriding other plugins extensions to Origen commands.
    
    Updated creation_info.rb and specs.rb so that a version number for the block can be set and passed with the ip block.
    
    Improvements to the Git driver. Forced checkout on the whole repository should work properly now, this means that the regression reference workspace should not reflect the requested version properly.
    Added git workspace information and plugin versions to pattern headers.
    Downgraded the plugin intergation check added recently to a warning rather than an error since Origen will still run in event of a problem being detected.

    Corrected usage of `sub_block_groups` (plural) so that it will
    work as before (handle a block to create a container) as an alias
    to `sub_block_group`, but when passed no arguments will serve
    to provide a hash of all sub block groups added thus far.
    Typo fix.  Update will prob break 'sub_block_groups' previous
    functionality (with the 's') but I suspect it's not highly used at the
    moment (other than my project).
    Updated sub block groups to not regenerate the instance each time they
    are referenced.  This permits updating static info for the instance that
    can be commonly used by the member sub blocks contained in the group.

    similar blocks, with unique classes.
    
    e.g.
    
    ~~~ruby
      sub_block_group :my_ip_group do
        sub_block :ip0, class_name: 'IP0', base_address: 0x000000
        sub_block :ip1, class_name: 'IP1', base_address: 0x000200
        sub_block :ip2, class_name: 'IP2', base_address: 0x000400
        sub_block :ip3, class_name: 'IP3', base_address: 0x000600
      end
    ~~~
    Creates an array referenced by a method called `my_ip_group`
    which contains the sub_block instances for `ip0`, `ip1`, `ip2`, `ip3`.
    Deprecated instance: option to sub_block method.  Use sub_block_groups
    instead.
    Updated to support custom container class for sub_block_group method.
    Added method sub_block_group to support defining an associated group of

    Patch to site_config
    Some misc final cleanup
    Updated workspace to new boot system
    Revert including the entire Origen module in the site config. Created a boot_api.rb file to house helpers that site config ERB templates can use. Updated the docs to cover ERB templating in the site config, since this slipped through the original PR (was only discussed wrt a centralized config)
    Working on new in-app boot system
    A bit more cleanup. Set the ERB settings to match the compile ones (%<>). Added including the current Origen module to the site config to allow the ERBs to use things like Origen.running_on_windows? or Origen.hostname

    Bugfix to make path in user_install_dir in terms of the site configs before it. I.e., if the topmost config moves the home_dir, the user_install_dir will see it.

    Fix lint errors.
    Updates:
    
    Added feedback from @ginty to PR with one exception: as I writing the docs, I found myself using the word <code>global</code> often and it was starting to lose meaning. Additionally, I ended up using <code>universal install</code>, to refer to the actual IT-managed installation (like what we have in NXP) so then universal vs. global install was getting convoluted. So, since the global install is really geared towards being used in a TR (tool-repository) package, I renamed <code>global</code> to <code>tool_repo</code>. I.e., <code>global_install_dir</code> to <code>tool_repo_install_dir</code>. I can change it back to <code>global</code> though, but I think it helped the docs flow better and not use <code>global</code> to mean few different things.
    
    Updated docs. I added a new page to the 'getting started' section about invocations, updated the plugin creation guide to discuss sharing global commands, and added an 'advanced topics' section to talk about the different installation options using the site config. I put this in a new section since I think it's out of the scope of just 'getting started' but also kind of an off-the-wall feature that may just clutter up the 'misc' section. I can move it though if needed.
    
    Small fix to the 'fix_my_workspace' script since it always wanted to use the universal install.
    
    Added application options to global commands since I forgot about this last time.
    
    I found that if a YAML file exists but is empty of any parameters, the load will 'succeed' but the results is nil. I.e., an empty site config add the value 'nil' into the site-configs arrray, causing Ruby to explode. Added fix for this.
    
    Made some changes to the site config to give <code>gem_install_dir</code> and <code>user_install_dir</code> some dynamic default values without needing to evaluate anything from the site config.
    Clean up for lint. Specs passing now.
    Initial attempt at global origen commands.

    More patches to help OrigenSim
    Initial app dir support
    Fix for #222
    Fixed a bug where the file handler was erroring when it found the same file twice with Dir.glob.  Was due to the matches.flatten.uniq call being inside a conditional.  Bug only occurred if user does not specify the program dir when running origen -p
    Preserve file handler state when Origen operations are launched programatically

    Added some cases to check if the 'app' is the Origen module and update files and paths accordingly.
    
    Added a 'private' accessor that will make the session file only read/writable by the user. Permissions: 600. Default is 664. This is available for any session, global or application. Added .private? method as well to check if this is set.
    
    Changed around the return strings if the 'app' is Origen. Reads as 'Origen's Global Session'.
    
    Update session.md.erb accordingly.

    Removed the format check on the version to compare against in the regression command. If your app uses Git, this means you can also enter a commit hash or branch ID to specify the reference version to compare against.
    
    Improved differ (Origen::Utility::Diff), this will now correctly ignore end of line comments and not just the full line comments.
    Added better error checking for when plugins overriding other plugins extensions to Origen commands.
    
    Updated creation_info.rb and specs.rb so that a version number for the block can be set and passed with the ip block.
    
    Improvements to the Git driver. Forced checkout on the whole repository should work properly now, this means that the regression reference workspace should not reflect the requested version properly.
    Added git workspace information and plugin versions to pattern headers.
    Downgraded the plugin intergation check added recently to a warning rather than an error since Origen will still run in event of a problem being detected.

    Some improvements to the Spec API:
    
    - $dut.spec can now be used as an alias for $dut.specs when looking up specs.
    - Made spec objects a little nicer to work with in the console and made the output more consistent with other APIs like the Register API. This update has removed the :verbose option that was supported by some APIs, its implementation was a bit confusing.
    - For now multiple specs are shown in the console as an array of names, and single specs are shown as a table. A future enhancement can be made in the future to view multiple specs in tabular form if required.
    - Added a test to clarify how fuzzy spec finding works, but no changes have been made at this time.

    Removed the format check on the version to compare against in the regression command. If your app uses Git, this means you can also enter a commit hash or branch ID to specify the reference version to compare against.
    
    Improved differ (Origen::Utility::Diff), this will now correctly ignore end of line comments and not just the full line comments.
    Added better error checking for when plugins overriding other plugins extensions to Origen commands.
    
    Updated creation_info.rb and specs.rb so that a version number for the block can be set and passed with the ip block.
    
    Improvements to the Git driver. Forced checkout on the whole repository should work properly now, this means that the regression reference workspace should not reflect the requested version properly.
    Added git workspace information and plugin versions to pattern headers.
    Downgraded the plugin intergation check added recently to a warning rather than an error since Origen will still run in event of a problem being detected.

    Changed power domain class to better name an attribute and provide a default for unit_voltage_range attribute
    Changed PowerDomain.voltage_range to nominal_voltage_range because it really refers to the range a unit could be fused to a specific value based on power/performance.  The PowerDomain class still needs to integrate spec limits that would handle the full range

    * Some general controller improvements and additional test coverage. * The failing stacktrace shown in the console now only shows callers from within the current   application. Previous behavior that would show the complete trace (including calls in plugins   and Origen core) can be restored by running with --verbose. * A proc can now be assigned as a target to use some custom code rather than a target file, this   is mainly intended to used within tests:  ~~~ruby Origen.target.temporary = -> {  = SomeLocalClass.new }  # Any calls to load or reload the target will now execute the above function ~~~

    Updated web links to origen-sdk.org to use HTTPS protocol due to website
    update.
    Some general windows fixes for web compilation and site config. Added some spec command changes to improve usage and robustness. Added support for application, shared plugin, and current plugin pattern headers. Deprecated existing Origen.config.pattern_header usage and added docs. Also, the current mode is printed to the pattern header. Bugfix for the default target. Added YARDOC for the collector. Added feature to improve failing the application, including specs and docs. Added fix for DesignSync 2017 header.
    sigh... forgot lint (again)

    Changed namespace from RGen to Origen
    Initial commit of snapshot from RGen v2.5.0.pre120
    Removed all of the legacy import system and added improved API for
    working with plugins.
    Some legacy APIs have been deprecated. Removed most of the sub-commands
    from the 'origen pl' command, these might be reintroduced in the future.
    Lint cleanup
    Removed the format check on the version to compare against in the regression command. If your app uses Git, this means you can also enter a commit hash or branch ID to specify the reference version to compare against.
    
    Improved differ (Origen::Utility::Diff), this will now correctly ignore end of line comments and not just the full line comments.
    Added better error checking for when plugins overriding other plugins extensions to Origen commands.
    
    Updated creation_info.rb and specs.rb so that a version number for the block can be set and passed with the ip block.
    
    Improvements to the Git driver. Forced checkout on the whole repository should work properly now, this means that the regression reference workspace should not reflect the requested version properly.
    Added git workspace information and plugin versions to pattern headers.
    Downgraded the plugin intergation check added recently to a warning rather than an error since Origen will still run in event of a problem being detected.

    Fix issue #71.  Tiny release should send production email
    Introduce maillists for release notification.
    Removed Freescale-specific stuff from user model. Enabled mailer and
    LDAP system from site_config.
