    standalone _python2.sh first line updated
    
    standalone_python2.sh updated to run Python easily on Terminal:
    As Android executs commands after searching from /system/bin directory and  not from /bin directory ,the first line of standalone_python2.sh has to be  changed from #! /bin/sh to as shown below:
    #! /system/bin/sh
    After this is done and this new edited file is  copied to /system/bin directory,then Python can be easily run on Terminal app with this command:
    standalone_python2.sh
    you can rename this script to whatever you desire and use that name as command.
    If you use previous version of standalone _python2.sh  file  and try to use command: standalone _python2.sh to run Python, you will get error as :No such file
    Earlier,you had to run Python on Terminal with command like this:
    sh /system/bin/standalone _python2.sh
    This command is longer  and there are chances of mistake in typing.
    By using updated version,you can easily run Python now.

    Don't interfere with `setuptools.sh`'s shebang
    
    `python-libs/setuptools.sh` must run inside a `bash` (as it
    uses `pushd`/`popd`), and its shebang says so. Therefore, the
    Makefile must not launch it as `sh setuptools.sh`, because
    that overrides the shebang, and thus the desired shell,
    to `sh`.
    
    This commit changes `setuptools.sh`'s file access mode to
    allow the Makefile to directly launch it, `./setuptools.sh`.
    It also changes the Makefile accordingly.

    Added setuptools to our Python base system, easy_install and pkg_resources are now available
    Don't interfere with `setuptools.sh`'s shebang
    
    `python-libs/setuptools.sh` must run inside a `bash` (as it
    uses `pushd`/`popd`), and its shebang says so. Therefore, the
    Makefile must not launch it as `sh setuptools.sh`, because
    that overrides the shebang, and thus the desired shell,
    to `sh`.
    
    This commit changes `setuptools.sh`'s file access mode to
    allow the Makefile to directly launch it, `./setuptools.sh`.
    It also changes the Makefile accordingly.
    Use HTTPS for downloading `setuptools`
    
    Also fix the download URL by removing a duplicate forward slash.

    * hostpython is needed to compile.
      In Fedora 21, system's distutils has many options for the x86_64 compile.
      So they cause to conflict to arm options in cross compiling such as:
      -m64 vs -mtune=xscale.
    * setuptools must be installed to hostpython.
    Compile succeed PyCrypto 2.6.1 for python 2.7.9.

    Install Eggs into /data/data/com.googlecode.pythonforandroid/files/python/lib/python2.6/lib-dynload (path may no be the most common, but who cares\!), create .pth files during installation so egg files are automatically added to the sys.path. .pth files are created in /data/data/com.googlecode.pythonforandroid/files/lib/python2.6/site-packages/ using <eggfile with egg extension>.pth scheme, removed the install/uninstall button and the version strings, added an install script button. Egg files are not handled by the uninstaller any more (needs to be fixed)
