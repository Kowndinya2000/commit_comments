    Update to Freemarker 2.3.26, fail with an exception on template errors.
    
    Underlying issue for https://github.com/gbif/portal-feedback/issues/1464 —
    the Term interface in dwc-api has changed to include a Java 8 default
    implementation, and the DwcTerm no longer overrides this method. Freemarker
    wasn't picking up the default implementation, see the [Changelog](https://freemarker.apache.org/docs/versions_2_3_26.html).
    Remove old RecordIterator, replace with DwcRecordIterator.
    New version of gbif-common resolves problem with missing extension records.
