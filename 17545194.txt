    Style updates in support of page content
    
    Changed "inner" to "default-page" for CSS and body classes. Adjusted large heading styles. Added a page title to the default template as it seems that authors do not add the name of the page at the top of their content, so, better to add it to the template automatically.

    Build fix for pyinvoke requirement.
    Added the very basics of an invoke tasks file.
    Cleaned up dev requirements.
    Renamed test-requirements to dev-requirements.
    
    I'm going to be adding stuff like invoke here so the name's going to stop
    making sense soon.
    Do the KISS thing for page URLs.
    
    I had planned a more complex nav tool to organize pages within the URL
    structure, but that may not really be needed. So let's do the simple
    thing for now and that later if needed.
    Refactored settings layout for production.
    It lives
    Re-added the Gemfile.lock, we do need this checked in apparently.
