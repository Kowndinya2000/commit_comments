    add simplest extraction to count how many identifiers can be found with the best possible algorithm.
    Repair logging
    Changed to log4j2 from Apache
    Reformat code
    Move MLP files to appropriate locations
    #17 moved mlp files to the top level
    Enable coding conventions
    Create parent pom
    
    MLP requires the self hacked regexp module rseq.
    To make everything compile with maven, it is required
    to separate to parent and child pom model.
    - using multiset of identifiers instead of set, to have bag of features
    - unicode utils to normalize math unicode symbols
    - some renaming to have pojos that make more sense
    added unicode normalization
    more tests
    more careful exception handling when parsing math ml
    changed package name
    rewrote most of the code from scratch
    addede unit tests
    Update for pomlp project
    Still something broken in TexInfo.java line 82
    Update for pomlp project
    Still something broken in TexInfo.java line 82
    Still some problems with the new MLLIST here.
    Error must be in the differences between SimpleFeatureExtractorMapper and CreateCandidatesMapper.
    Delete not throwable exception from TextAnnotatorMapper.

    Ignore uncrossable documents
    
    After switching to sweble some documents can not be processed
    - For now we ignore these errors
    Integrate sweble part II
    Add local executor for identifier extraction
    Move MLP files to appropriate locations
    #17 moved mlp files to the top level
    Unnest MathTag class
    
    * Investigate failed ci tests.
    Add -T option to output TeX rather than unicode
    #4: adds additional CLI support
    plus some cleaning
    Enable coding conventions

    Complete refactoring of Results and XML output
    
    * Made Results into five classes, all marshallable and unmarshallable by
      XStream
    * Added unit tests for marshalling/unmarshalling
    * Minor changes to XML format:
      * Total attribute is removed from <results> (not part of NTCIR format)
              (Client)
            * Escaped html characters inside attribute values in BasicTest
              (Client)
      * Removed xmlns from <hit> (not part of NTCIR)
            * Added <run> tag in between <results> and <result> (part of NTCIR)
            * All tags self close when they have no children (resolves #64)
            * Removed new line after </results>
    Resolves #57
    Check xsede server connection
    
    * Check if connection is stable before running unit tests
    * See #67
    * Upgrade to HttpClient v 4.5
    * Remove old dependency on HttpClient Commons
    Fix bugs and testNtcirReturn
    
    * Fix bug where replaceAttr() removed namespaces (Client)
    * Use XMLUnit's XMLAssertEquals to check XML equality so that
      testNtcirReturn passes on Travis. The environment on Travis flipped
            attributes around, so a simple string comparison is not enough.
    Update dependency on querygenerator, fix unit tests
    
    * Update Client to disable qvar map in response to updated dependency
    * Fix CMML unit test to disable qvar map

    Simplify BaseX database creation
    
    Let com.formulasearchengine.mathosphere.basex.Server#startup
    pass the filename to basex without to parse the file internally.
    Fix: Adjust references
    
    The update of the baseX version caused a slightly difference in the xref
    attribute. In particular there is a trailing / at the beginning of the
    file name now.
    Complete refactoring of Results and XML output
    
    * Made Results into five classes, all marshallable and unmarshallable by
      XStream
    * Added unit tests for marshalling/unmarshalling
    * Minor changes to XML format:
      * Total attribute is removed from <results> (not part of NTCIR format)
              (Client)
            * Escaped html characters inside attribute values in BasicTest
              (Client)
      * Removed xmlns from <hit> (not part of NTCIR)
            * Added <run> tag in between <results> and <result> (part of NTCIR)
            * All tags self close when they have no children (resolves #64)
            * Removed new line after </results>
    Resolves #57
    Fix bugs and testNtcirReturn
    
    * Fix bug where replaceAttr() removed namespaces (Client)
    * Use XMLUnit's XMLAssertEquals to check XML equality so that
      testNtcirReturn passes on Travis. The environment on Travis flipped
            attributes around, so a simple string comparison is not enough.

    Refactor exception handling and Client output
    
    * Make TexQueryGenerator and Client throw exceptions to indicate errors
      rather than returning a string with the error message. This makes it
            much easier to tell when something went wrong.
    * Make Client functions return Results and Result objects rather than
      an XML string. This makes it much easier to manipulate the objects for
            later functionality (such as pagination)
    * As above, make MathRequest store Results objects.
    
    Resolves #68
    Complete refactoring of Results and XML output
    
    * Made Results into five classes, all marshallable and unmarshallable by
      XStream
    * Added unit tests for marshalling/unmarshalling

              (Client)
            * Escaped html characters inside attribute values in BasicTest
              (Client)

            * Added <run> tag in between <results> and <result> (part of NTCIR)
            * All tags self close when they have no children (resolves #64)
            * Removed new line after </results>
    Resolves #57
    Initial refactoring of Results
    
    * Separate nested classes into different classes to make it easier to
      serialize into XML later
    * Remove csv option (added todo to add in moritz' translation xslt
            later
    * Added showTime methods to Run and Result to separate the classes (this
      will be refactored later into a global variable during xml
            serialization)

    Change-Id: I3b7eff660f0937d5f0f16acdcd8d8d2bf4babe12
    Update modules and dependencies
    
    MathML tools was updated
    Move xmlhelper class
    
    Move mathmlquerygenerator.xmlhelper to mathmltools.xmlhelper.
    Refactor exception handling and Client output
    
    * Make TexQueryGenerator and Client throw exceptions to indicate errors
      rather than returning a string with the error message. This makes it
            much easier to tell when something went wrong.
    * Make Client functions return Results and Result objects rather than
      an XML string. This makes it much easier to manipulate the objects for
            later functionality (such as pagination)
    * As above, make MathRequest store Results objects.
    
    Resolves #68
    Switch to using central XMLHelper
    
    * Updated commit id of MathMLQueryGenerator lib (relies on
