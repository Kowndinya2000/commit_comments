    VarargsParameterResolver should only support varargs as the last parameter, not an array.
    
    The previous behaviour was causing the VarargsParameterResolver to resolve the @Row("example") for a test method like public void test(String[] argument) as:
     new Object[]{new String{"example"}}
    
     when I need it to resolve as:
     new Object[]{"example"}
    
     for a ParameterResolver plugin for yatspec I am working on that will delegate to VarargsParameterResolver to deal with varargs and add some additional functionality on top of that.

    VarargsParameterResolver should only support varargs as the last parameter, not an array.
    
    The previous behaviour was causing the VarargsParameterResolver to resolve the @Row("example") for a test method like public void test(String[] argument) as:
     new Object[]{new String{"example"}}
    
     when I need it to resolve as:
     new Object[]{"example"}
    
     for a ParameterResolver plugin for yatspec I am working on that will delegate to VarargsParameterResolver to deal with varargs and add some additional functionality on top of that.
