    Update library.properties (#341)
    
    already compatible with stm32duino
    prepare version 2.6.3
    
    #317
    Some interesting add has been done into the master since 2.6.2 in particular #139
    so let's go out a new version to make it available on arduino library manager
    Make the library compatible with the ESP32 architecture
    Update library.properties
    solve Arduino IDE library warnings
    
    1. get rid of unrecognized category warning in Arduino IDE. It doesn't seem to support multiple categories
    2. add esp8266 to the list of architctures to avoid warnings about incompatible architecture. This library works on esp8266
    adding library.properties for arduino library manager
    prepare version 2.6.3
