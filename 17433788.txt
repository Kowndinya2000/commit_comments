    Add target change for channels.
    
    This has a separate enabling option channel::channel_target_change.
    
    It applies to PRIVMSG, NOTICE and TOPIC by unvoiced unopped non-opers.
    
    The same slots are used for channels and users.
    Update target change documentation.
    target change: use fnv32 hash of UID instead of pointer to identify clients
    This way, the information remains valid after a split.
    For clients on TS5 servers, the nick is used; this is
    not much of a problem because these are on pseudoservers
    and not assumed to change nick much at all.

    - Mention that some users may be able to bypass +g.
    - Mention that /accept may allow more than just going through +g.

      not just one user.

    [svn] Port over ratbox 2.2 r23507, r23624, r23626 (jilles/anfl):
    Change TS6 JOIN processing
    - don't send out simple modes in TS6 JOIN and TS5 SJOIN when
      a local user joins an existing channel
    - don't send out simple modes in TS6 JOIN and TS5 SJOIN when
      propagating a TS6 JOIN
    - don't interpret simple modes in an incoming TS6 JOIN
    
    This is to avoid desyncs when certain mode changes (e.g. -im)
    cross with joins. A downside is that simple modes will be
    more desynched when a JOIN creates a channel or lowers TS,
    but that's less important.
    
    Update the TS6 specification to include this, and clarify
    that TMODE can come from a server and that MODE must be
    translated into TMODE from other servers too.
