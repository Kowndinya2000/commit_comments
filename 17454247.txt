    Side B
    Side A
    Legobot defence code updated.
    Added light code, untested.
    Working LegoBot code.
    No blockers anymore. LEFT SIDE works well so do not calibrate any values unless something major goes wrong. Also, @ fast_speed = 900, comp ratio = 0.999 or 1.002. If this ratio is not as above, run @ a lower fast_speed such that the comp ratio is as accurate as above.
    LOTS OF CHANGES. Legobot is not going straight and needs work.
    LegoBot: Calibration for side B.
    Create: Added accel for after block pickup FOR ONLY SIDE A. Please transfer to side B.
    2 pivot beginning. haven't tested fully
    full motion legobot
    working code with blockers!!
    Everything works @ 950 FAST_SPEED and full charge (MUST HAVE full charge)
    Victor's code with 950 speed (no twitching)
    Changed move to distance. Motors still DO NOT work.
    edited speed constants.
    Standardized speed constants
    Fixted turnArc and constants
    Fixed constants. Need to double-check values and code.
    Eric and Madhu's code and stuff. Some other small differences
    changed some of the blocker functions; edited comments to reflect changes;
    Josh's code for the legoBot.
    Updated some legobot Functions
    Code written by Josh and Nick that is the newest legotbot at the time.
    Adding Legobot code for this year written so far by Josh, Nick, and Madoo with a little Praneet add on.
    
    This code is just a basic structure of the files we can build off of to code the Legobot.
    Legobot code committed by Victor. Last two scores on A side, 55 and 50.
    for wasting legobot power
    Legobot defence code updated.
    Works on both sides.
    Legobot Main done for the night.
    Joey sucks at Tetris.
    Legobot code committed by Victor. Last two scores on A side, 55 and 50.
    changed some legobot code
    Added light code, untested.
    Modified how the bot interferes in enemy territory.
    Modified code to also work on side A.
    Preliminary, untested side A code based on side B code.
    calibrated values
    side a and side b changed.
    fixed back up distance on safety (2nd) attempt to drop balls in the biofuel bulk storage
    Changed moveToDistance to moveToDist to make analogous to the create code.
    Finished for Monday. Works sort of well with Create.
    Changed backup value to drop balls.
    Working LegoBot code.
    few angles changed on side A
    side a changed.
    Changed side A code to match side B code. Not tested yet.
    shut_down_in 120 seconds added; minor value changed
    added a arc to avoid collision with create
    edited legobot main a bit
    worked on create main code, a bit of legobot main
    No blockers anymore. LEFT SIDE works well so do not calibrate any values unless something major goes wrong. Also, @ fast_speed = 900, comp ratio = 0.999 or 1.002. If this ratio is not as above, run @ a lower fast_speed such that the comp ratio is as accurate as above.
    updated legobotMain.c for stuff after dumping biofuels
    changed values.
    changed values. side a working at the moment.
    Major callibration. Both sides need callibration for bots.
    Added side B. Needs callibration.
    new pivot mechanism
    commented heavily
    Few changes.
    
    Found out that the blockers inhibit the ability for the legoBot to move over the center. We can ameliorate this issue by lightening the blockers or altering the center of mass.
    pivots work, check angles
    2 pivot beginning. haven't tested fully
    full motion legobot

    moveToDistAccel is working! It is so dirty. It's a dirty dirty girl that needs to be cleaned along with the rest of the code.

    Having problems with setClaw. The servos are acting very very weird.
    A button on this code tested the moveToDistance function and showed that it worked. Please do not change the stop distance ratio.
    
    The function gets close to the right distance and is pretty consistent when comparing two runs. It accelerates and deccelerates.
    Modified the claw as well as other functions. aRobot.c picks up the paper airplane and drops it off in the runway.
    Created moveToDistanceAccel but oh god it's horrible. Someone please clean it. It works, I think.
    moveToDistanceAccel added but needs heavy testing and refinement.
