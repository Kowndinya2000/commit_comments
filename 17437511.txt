    Android 5 adds audio configuration callback for the a2dp HAL. This
    callback is used only by newly introduced a2dp sink role. A2dp Sink
    uses the same HAL API as Source role does. Of course there is a
    sepparate HAL instance for Sink and just the interface is common with
    Source role.

    This patch clarifies that 0x80 opcode is reserved and not used. This is
    in case we need to introduce confirmations for notifications.
    
    Error response definition is moved into common place and all HALs are
    simply referring to it. This is to keep valid status values in single
    place. Valis status is also updated with 'Authentication Rejected'
    error added in Android 5.0 API.

    android: Fix Handsfree volume command notification description
    android/hidhost: Remove deprecated idle opcode from ipc document
    
    Idle time is deprecated in HID_SPEC1_1. So get and set idle time api's
    are removed and not implemented. But callback is left out in Android
    bt_hh.h. Generally this callback needs to be called when HAL requests
    get and set idle time calls with status. So the method calls itself
    removed, no point to implement this callback.
    Also update GET_REPORT and VIRTUAL_UNPLUG opcode values.
    android/hid: Add missing hid send data parameters in ipc document
    android/hid: Remove fixed number of hid set report data length in ipc doc

    doc: fix minor typos
    
    The documentation contained minor typos which are being fixed here.
    doc/coding-style: Update 'enum as switch variable' section
    
    Since GCC has option (-Wswitch-enum) that ensure all enum values are
    handled inside switch it is no longer necessary to forbit default in
    such case.
    doc: Fix unicode in coding style document
    doc/coding-style: Minor formatting fix
    doc: Add initial documentation for coding style
    input: Documentation for new Input1 interface
    
    Adds documentation for a new Input1 interface explaining a new
    "ReconnectMode" property that exposes the Connectability mode of
    a HID device.
    input: Remove Input interface
    
    This interface is no longer needed as Device interface can now connect
    the profiles.
    Update copyright information
    Remove deprecated methods and signals from input interface
    Update documentation.
    Mention the variable prefix of an object path
    Fix whitespaces
    Remove CancelConnect methods
    Add CancelConnect() and IsConnected() methods
    Add basic API document for new input interface
    doc/adapter-api: Add Roles property
    
    This change adds a new property to indicate the support for concurrent
    roles which means that the controller has reported the appropriate
    LE_Supported_States (hdev->le_states) and that the controller's driver
    has reported correctly handling the various reported states.
    doc/adapter-api: Add pattern filter
    
    This adds a pattern filter which can be used to filter devices by
    address or name prefix which is quite convenient on a crowded
    environment.
    doc/adapter-api: Fix working of Discoverable filter
    doc/adapter-api: Add Discoverable option to SetDiscoveryFilter
    
    This enables the client to set its discoverable setting while
    discovering which is very typical situation as usually the setings
    application would allow incoming pairing request while scanning, so
    this would reduce the number of calls setting Discoverable and
    DiscoverableTimeout and restoring after done with discovery.
    adapter: Add ConnectDevice method
    
    This allows to connect device without doing general discovery. This is
    needed for some of qualification tests where there is no general
    discovery upfront and we need to do connection to device with provided
    address.
    
    Another usecase is for scenario where scanning happen on one controller
    but connection handling on another.
    
    New device object is announced only if physical connection was
    successful. On success this method returns path to created device
    object. After ConnectProfile return bluetoothd continue with
    services discovery and profile connection.
    
    This patch implements bare minimum properties needed for connection -
    address and address type. If needed eg. for non-NFC based OOB it could
    be extended with more options.
    Add AddressType property for Adapter1 and Device1 interfaces
    
    This provides information about address type being used.  It is needed
    for L2CAP sockets and PTS testing purposes.
    adapter-api: Rename ResetData to DuplicateData filter
    
    Since essencially what this filter would be doing is disable duplicate
    for data use it instead of ResetData.
    
    Also inline the documentation of each filter option to make it easier to
    read what each option does.
    core: Add GetDiscoveryFilters
    
    In order to extend SetDiscoveryFilter with more filters the application
    might have to query what filters are available.
    core: Add ResetData filter
    
    Reset service/manufactorer data so the application can see each and
    every instance of them.
    doc/adapter-api: Fix SetDiscoveryFilter documentation
    
    The method is not set as experimental for while.
    core/device: Make filtered discovery able to detect beacons
    
    This makes it possible to use SetDiscoveryFilter to disable checking
    discoverable flags making it possible to see beacons such as the ones
    create by tools/eddystone that doesn't show on regular discovery sessions
    since they are not discoverable/connectable.
    doc/adapter-api: Add NotSupported error to SetDiscoveryFilter
    doc/adapter-api: Use correct signal name
    doc/adapter-api: SetDiscoveryFilter method.
    
    This patch proposes new method, SetDiscoveryFilter to D-Bus Adapter
    API for desktop bluetoothd. It will allow to set per-client discovery
    filter that would limit devices being discovered.
    doc: Fix trivial typo in adapter-api
    doc: Add entry for modalias properties
    doc: Add some extra notes to class of device adapter property
    doc: Introduce adapter alias property and make name property read only
    doc: Mention that the adapter powered property is not persistent
    doc: Mention the external control of adapter name property
    doc: Remove pointless copyright statements from core APIs
    doc: Add extra comments about default values to adapter properties
    adapter: Remove DevicesFound signal
    
    ObjectManager reports the D-Bus interfaces of all known devices,
    including the ones detected during discovery. Therefore this signal is
    not required.
    doc: Remove left-over mentions of adapter-based agent methods
    core: Remove RequestSession and ReleaseSession
    
    Sessions is no longer used by obexd and the concept is probably not
    relevant anymore since BlueZ 5 don't remember powered state anymore.
    dbus: Rename to org.bluez.Adapter1
    
    Trivially add the numbering suffix to org.bluez.Adapter according to
    the proposal for BlueZ 5.
    dbus: Rename to org.bluez.Device1
    
    Trivially add the numbering suffix to org.bluez.Device according to
    the proposal for BlueZ 5.
    adapter: Remove FindDevice method from D-Bus API
    
    ObjectManager.GetManagedObjects() returns all devices and their
    corresponding properties to any interested client. The device address is
    included in the property dictionary and therefore having such a
    FindDevice method is an unnecessary duplication.
    adapter: Remove redundant Devices property
    
    The ObjectManager interface already reports the list of devices, so the
    the property can be entirely removed.
    adapter: Remove DeviceCreated/DeviceRemoved signals
    
    The Adapter interface already reports changes in the device list in form
    of property changes, so there is no need to keep these two signals.
    doc: Update to match latest BlueZ 5 API
    doc: Update adapter and device D-Bus APIs
    adapter: Remove unused Broadcaster property
    
    Applications that want to be Observers of certain Advertising data type
    (e.g. Manufacturer Specific Data or Service Data) will use new Observer
    D-Bus API to monitor these AD types. Therefore, the old Broadcaster
    device property is unnecessary.
    doc: Mention GATT when creating devices
    
    CreatePairedDevice and CreateDevice trigger GATT discover all primary
    services procedure if the device is Bluetooth Low Energy.
    adapter: remove deprecated ListDevices() method

    Update Adapter API documentation
    
    RequestSession and ReleaseSession description is updated in adapter
    API.
    Add Broadcaster property in DeviceFound signal
    
    Broadcaster property is required to distinguish the device role. If the
    remote is sending an advertising event, two possible roles are possible:
    Peripheral or Broadcaster.
    
    This change is required to pass on qualification tests which require
    filtering Broadcasting devices during General Discovery Procedure.
    Fix typo in adapter documentation
    Fix typos in adapter documentation
    Fix adapter API
    
    Some possible errors returned by GetProperty and SetProperty are not
    applied anymore. GetProperty returns NotReady only. SetProperty returns
    InvalidArguments only.
    Report local services(UUIDs) through D-Bus
    
    * Include UUIDs field to method GetProperties(org.bluez.Adapter).
    Applications can get local services(UUIDs) available through D-Bus.
    * UUIDs per-adapter stored at btd_adapter to prevent some searches not
    necessary regarding it requires information from access_db and service_db.
    * Emit Adapter.PropertyChanged signal when UUIDs change.
    Add {deprecated} annotation to ListDevices()
    Update copyright information
    Add "Class" property to org.bluez.Adapter interface.
    Update adapter documentation.
    Add documentation for PairableTimeout property.
    Introduce Pairable property.
    
    As the name suggest it tells when an adapter enter or leaves bondable
    mode, it works as follow:
    Pairable=true & Discoverable=true: limited IAC
    Pairable=true & Discoverable=false: pairable but inquiry scan disabled
    Pairable=false & Discoverable=true: inquiry scan enabled (with Generic IAC)
    but new pairings cannot be created (same as if there was no agent)
    Pairable=false & Discoverable=false: inquiry scan disabled & non-pairable
    (as if there was no agent)
    Clarify the agent parameter usage with CreatePairedDevice
    Implement first part of CancelDeviceCreation
    
    Currently only canceling of CreatePairedDevice is supported

    Add CreateDeviceWithAgent to adapter API.
    Add new D-Bus API documentation.
    doc/device-api: Add WakeAllowed
    
    Add documentation for WakeAllowed, which allows a device to wake the
    system from suspend.
    doc/device-api: Add AdvertisingData property
    
    This adds AdvertisingData which exposes data being advertised which is
    may be useful for profiles not handled by bluetoothd.
    Add AddressType property for Adapter1 and Device1 interfaces
    
    This provides information about address type being used.  It is needed
    for L2CAP sockets and PTS testing purposes.
    device: Don't disable auto-connect for trusted devices
    
    Trusted shall indicate if the device is allowed connect in any
    circumstance, even if the user has called device.Disconnect.
    doc/device-api: Document behavior of Disconnect method with LE
    
    If and LE device is disconnected using device.Device method it won't
    be able to reconnect by itself.

    This exposed Advertising Flags to BlueZ Device API
    doc/device-api: Document Connect behavior for dual-mode
    
    Adds description of how Device1.Connect behave with dual-mode devices.
    core/device: Promote LE related properties to stable
    
    This promotes ManufacturerData, ServiceData, TxPower and ServicesResolved
    to stable since those might be needed in order to take advantage of the
    GATT D-Bus APIs.
    doc/device-api: Replace GattServices with ServicesDiscovered property
    
    GattServices is not really doing was it was meant to do which was to
    track progress of service discovery since it only worked for the very
    first time a device is connected but since we no longer remove the
    attributes an application would have the false impression the service are
    all resolved by the time it reconnects when in fact the service may have
    changed.
    
    Furthermore object tracking like it is doing has been obsolete by
    ObjectManager so this propose to replace the service discovery tracking
    with a boolean property which works both with SDP as well as GATT
    discovery.
    doc/device-api: Add GattServices
    
    This patch introduces the GattServices property that contains the object
    paths of exported GattService1 objects. The purpose of this property is
    to signal when all GATT services on a remote device have been
    discovered.
    doc/device-api: Add TxPower
    
    This adds TxPower from advertisement data.
    doc/device-api: Add ServiceData and ManufacturerData
    
    This adds ServiceData and ManufacturerData from advertisement data.

    doc: Remove bogus DeviceFound signal reference
    doc: Update RSSI property description.
    
    RSSI property applies to either inquiry or advertising packets and this
    should be stated here especially that we plan to add connection RSSI
    property.
    doc: Add missing Device1.Pair error
    doc: Document missing errors returned by the Device1 API.
    
    There were two groups of missing error messages in the documentation:
    * For org.bluez.Device1.DisconnectProfile:
      This method could certainly call btd_error_not_supported or
      btd_error_failed returning those errors.
    * For org.bluez.Device1.Pair:
      The pairing process could certainly call new_authentication_return
      which can return (and actualy does) five other different errors.
    doc: Fix optional properties not marked as such
    
    Commit 826023de56896e83f35ae69a73d6a120a2f5b11e made some of the
    device's properties optional but the documentation was not updated
    accordingly. More specifically, the properties 'Name' and 'UUIDs' won't
    be present if the information is not available.
    doc: Add missing device RSSI property
    
    RSSI property was not documented in device API.

    Read the PNP ID characteristic of the DeviceInfo Service, and
    store it inside the btd_device, for use by other profiles.
    Add Vendor, Product and Version properties to org.bluez.Device
    
    This identifiers can be used by applications to implements quirks which
    seems to be very common in some profiles such as syncml and since this
    information is already stored permanently we can quickly retrieve it
    without having to connect or parse the records again.
    Fix minor typo
    Add a new property "Services" on the Device object
    
    Array of object paths representing the remote characteristics based

    This patch adds tests and required test infrastructure for multi
    advertising tests.
    tools/mgmt-tester: test le off
    
    Test that advertising instances will be removed when disabling the le
    capability of a brle bluetooth device.
    tools/mgmt-tester: test advertising timeout
    
    The change introduces an additional test that waits for an advertising
    timeout to occur and checks whether the timed out advertising instance
    is correctly being removed and - if it was the last instance -
    advertising disabled.
    tools/mgmt-tester: test adv inst override
    
    This test covers a use case that had not been tested before: When an
    advertising instance has already been added and is then added again with
    different advertising data, the new advertising data should be
    advertised.
    tools/mgmt-tester: keep instances on power cycle
    
    Tests that instances that do not have a timeout will survive a power
    cycle.
    tools: Add initial HCI User Channel tester
    
    This adds basic tests only.

    doc/advertising-api: Add support for setting Secondary Channel
    
    This enables reading and setting the Secondary Channel/PHY supported
    by the controller.
    doc/advertising-api: Add DiscoverableTimeout property
    
    This property can control how long an instance is visible.
    doc/advertising-api: Add Discoverable property
    
    This adds Discoverable which the application can use in case it want
    to set the General Discoverable flag per instance.
    
    Note: This would allow for example an application to advertise as
    discoverable even if the adapter is not discoverable which may be
    required by dual-mode as it may not require BR/EDR to be discoverable.
    doc/advertising-api: Add Data property
    
    Data property can be used to add advertising data with arbitrary/profile
    specific type.

    advertised, as opposed to just including the adapter's appearance.
    advertising: Add LocalName property
    
    With this property applications can select their own local name to be
    advertised, as opposed to just including the adapter's name.
    advertising: Add Includes property
    
    This enables using the all the supporting includes.
    
    Note: IncludeTxPower has been moved under Includes as well since it was
    still experimental.
    advertising: Add SupportedIncludes
    
    This adds SupportedIncludes so application can detect what the system
    can include.
    advertising: Add ActiveInstances property
    
    This property indicates how many instance are currently in use.
    advertising: Rename AdvertisementInstaces to SupportedInstances
    
    This fixes the typo and removes the term advertisement since it is
    implicit given the interface name, also make it experimental since
    AdvertisingManager is still experimental.

    Small fix in Health API documentation
    
    Channel path skeleton is fixed in documentation, in order to
    reflect atual implementation.
    Add Application property to HealthChannel
    
    This patch adds the Application property to HealthChannel, which
    allows to unambiguously relate a channel to an application.
    
    This property is useful when there are several processes interested
    in accepting HealthChannels but device address is not sufficient
    criteria to engage upon, or ignore, the ChannelConnected signal.
    Having the application path allows to determine role and data type,
    in the context of the process that has created that application.
    Create a GetProperties function for HealthDevice
    Changes in Health API
    
    Connections are made directly to a device and bluetoothd daemon
    guess the PSM connection and the MDEPID based on the data get
    from the SDP record.
    
    Also a property that indicates the first realiable channel is
    added to the HealthDevice object.
    Rename Register/UnregisterApplication to Create/DestroyApplication
    
    Create/Destroy makes more sense since the application is created on the
    bluetoothd side whereas what's really registered is an agent on the
    caller side. This way the call is similar to e.g. CreatePairedDevice,
    and so the parameter order should also be config first and then the
    agent.
    Add first proposal for Health Device Profile API
    profiles/battery: Add Bluetooth LE Battery service
    
    The Battery Level characteristic was tested with a

    The Battery1 interface is now exported for Bluetooth LE devices which
    support the Battery Level characteristic, providing a single
    "Percentage" value to other integration points in the OS, such as UPower
    for consumption on most free desktops.

    - Advertisement Monitor Removed event
    Note that the content of a monitor can differ based on its type. For now we
    introduce only pattern-based monitor, so you may find that unlike the
    command of removing monitor(s), the Add command is tied to a specific type.

    This change adds the definition for the read/set default parameter
    commands.
    
    In particular, these commands are used to read and set the system
    default parameters.  The use of a TLV format also ensures that
    parameters are expandable in the future.
    
    This will allow bluetoothd to load parameters from a conf file that may
    be customized for the specific requirements of each platforms.

    doc/mgmt-api: multi-adv implementation details
    
    A few additional decisions have been made while implementing the
    multi-advertising feature where the mgmt api spec was leaving room for
    interpretation. These changes are being documented in this patch.
    doc: Update the details for mgmt version 1.9
    doc: Add description for Start Limited Discovery command
    doc: Add note about LE Privacy and out-of-band data update
    doc: Introduce a command that notifies about local OOB data updates

    doc/mgmt-api: Make Fast Connectable available while powered off
    doc/mgmt-api: Add note about power off while fast connectable
    doc/mgmt-api: Set Fast Connectable is allowed while not connectable
    
    Now that the page scan state isn't strictly tied to the connectable
    setting (adding BR/EDR devices to the kernel whitelist may enable it as
    well) we shouldn't prevent fast-connectable from getting set while
    connectable is not set.
    doc: Add information about static address controller setting
    doc: Clarify the usage of the static address for dual-mode controllers
    doc/mgmt-api: Add security level to new CSRK events
    
    In order to distinguish between LE Security Mode 2 levels 1 and 2 we
    need to know whether a CSRK is authenticated or unauthenticated. So far
    this information wasn't available in the New CSRK event from the kernel.
    
    This patch renames the Master parameter of the event to Type and adds
    two new values to it. The two old values 0x00 and 0x01 still have the
    same meaning as before from the local/remote CSRK perspective. Since we
    so far have not known anything about the security level these values
    must be assumed to be unauthenticated.
    
    The consequence of this update is that authenticated keys with new
    kernels will simply be ignored by existing code (which only accepts
    values 0x00 and 0x01), however since we haven't really had any code
    doing real signing so far this should be an acceptable compromise.
    doc/mgmt-api: Update error codes for Pair Device Command
    
    This patch adds two error codes for Pair device command.
    
    Reject error code which is used when requested transport is not enabled.
    E.g. User wants to do LE pair but LE support is not enabled. Similar
    with BREDR
    
    Not Supported error code which is used if controller is not capable with
    requested transport

    Those commands don't send any HCI commands to controller so there is no
    need to restrict them to only powered up controller. This also clarify
    that provided OOB data is persistent over power down/up toggles.
    mgmt: Remove peripheral setting
    
    It's still not decided how this will be exposed in the end but most
    likely it wont be through mgmt (e.g. socket-based enabling is a probable
    choice).

    mgmt-api: Clarify unpair_device disconnect parameter
    mgmt-api: Fix PIN Code command & reponse parameters
    mgmt-api: Add status parameter to command complete event
    
    Since this is needed by almost all command responses it makes more sense
    to just have it part of the command complete event.
    mgmt-api: Add address_type to start_discovery response
    mgmt-api: Remove bogus old_key_type parameter
    mgmt-api: Add Address_Type to all messages with an Address
    
    Strictly speaking the address type isn't needed in all messages (e.g.
    those specific to BR/EDR or pre-2.1) but for consistency it's cleaner to
    have it everywhere. The only exception is the read_controller_info reply
    where it really doesn't make sense to have it.
    mgmt-api: Fix typo with wrong capitalization
    mgmt-api: Reorder parameters for read_commands
    
    It makes more sense to have the num_commands and num_events parameters
    in the beginning so that the message length can be validated up front.
    mgmt-api: Add proper management supported commands command
    mgmt-api: Remove bogus Key_Type field from LTK messages
    mgmt-api: Update to latest plans
    
    - "Remove Keys" renamed to "Unpair Device" and moved to a more
      appropriate location (after the other pairing commands)
    - "Device Unpaired" event added
    - Address_Type parameters added the relevant commands and events
    - Address_Type vs Key_Type distinction made clearer
    - Bogus '0' removed from opcodes
    mgmt-api: Move New Long Term Key Event to a more logical place
    mgmt-api: Remove unused/implemented commands
    mgmt-api: Move Load Long Term Keys Command to a more logical place
    mgmt-api: Add missing cancel pairing command
    mgmt-api: Add information about endianness
    
    Management interface use little-endian byte order and this should be
    clearly stated in documentation.
    mgmt-api: Update the commands for exchanging LTK's
    
    For restoring the device from storage we need to have the Address type
    of the device, the LTK is a good place for this.
    
    In some cases, we may be notified of keys that were generated in the
    Host, that key key would be used when the Host is the slave role in
    a later connection, we should be able to differentiate this type of
    key because it doesn't mean that we have a bonding with the Remote
    Device.
    mgmt-api: Use 2 octets instead of 1 for EIR data length
    
    This allows for future extensibility.
    mgmt-api: Use EIR encoding wherever possible
    
    We can encode the remotee name and class to the EIR data format both in
    device_found and device_connected events.
    mgmt-api: Update to latest plans
    
    - Remove the remote_name event and add the name to the device_connected
    event (since we always refresh the name at that point anyway).
    
    - Add Class of Device to device_connected since that's the only point
    where we get it when a previously unknown device connects to us for the
    first time.
    
    - Add a Flags field to device_found to accommodate for legacy pairing
    information (which we get from the remote host features HCI event) and
    merge the only other existing boolean parameter (confirm_name) into this
    Flags field.
    mgmt-api: Update Confirm Name return parameters
    mgmt: Move Set Local Name to it's logical position in the API
    mgmt-api: Update to match latest plans
    mgmt-api: Add missing changes to the mgmt messages
    
    Some changes were missing from the previous patch. This moves the fast
    connectable command to the right place, adds a Class_Of_Device parameter
    to Set UUID Caching (renamed from Set Service Cache) and adds a Class Of
    Device Changed event.
    mgmt-api: Update to current plans
    
    This patch updates the mgmt API to match the current plans. This is
    hopefully the last major change and because of that the command and
    event codes are also reshuffled to match some kind of a logical
    ordering.
    mgmt: Add address type to mgmt_pair_device
    
    This is important especially in the future when dual-mode devices can be
    connected to over LE. It's also important if/when we decide to move the
    advertisement cache into user-space.
    mgmt: Add status parameter to disconnect response
    mgmt: Add bdaddr and status to remove_keys response
    mgmt: Add LE public/random info to address types
    mgmt-api: Update get_connections and connect_failed with address type info
    mgmt-api: Only 4 bytes are needed for the controller settings
    mgmt-api: Fix typos and consistency issues
    Make whitespace usage consistent in mgmt-api.txt
    mgmt: Rename Name Info command to match corresponding flag
    mgmt: Allow specifying discovery type for Start Discovery
    Add new command and event for LTK storage support
    
    This documents the new command and event that are to be added to
    the Management API to add support for persistent pairing of LE
    devices.
    Add device type to found and connected mgmt events
    Add User Passkey commands and events to mgmt
    Rename mgmt key commands and events
    Add timeout to Set Discoverable mgmt command
    Update controller info command with current plan
    Fix whitespace for fast connectable mgmt command doc
    Add (legacy) name resolution handling to mgmt API
    Implement fast connectable mode for mgmt interface
    
    Management interface implementation for fast connectable mode.
    Add device blocking events to mgmt API documentation
    Fix typo in mgmt-api
    Add blacklisting support for management interface
    
    Management interface commands for blocking and unblocking devices.
    Update params description of PIN Code Request
    Add secure param to mgmt_ev_pin_code_request
    
    Update mgmt interface with secure param in PIN code request event which
    is part of secure PIN requirement implementation.
    mgmt: Add support for discovering event
    mgmt: Add support for start_discovery & stop_discovery
    Add device_found and remote_name events to mgmt-api.txt
    Update mgmt-api.txt with OOB commands
    mgmt: Implement adapter name control
    
    This patch adds a new set_local_name command as well as a
    local_name_changed event to the management interface. Instead of 248
    bytes (like in the HCI spec) 249 bytes are always reserved for the name
    in the messages so that there's a guarantee of it being nul-terminated
    (this is not guaranteed on the HCI level).
    mgmt: Add adapter name to read_info response
    Update mgmt-api.txt with controller index moved to mgmt packet header
    mgmt: Add support for auth_failed event and bonding_complete hooks
    
    This patch adds support for the mgmt_auth_failed event together with the
    related bonding_complete failure hooks to the core daemon.
    mgmt: Add User Confirmation request support
    mgmt: Add mgmt_pair_device command
    
    This patch adds a new management command for triggering a dedicated
    bonding procedure to a remote device.
    mgmt: Add set_io_capability command
    mgmt: Add PIN Code request handling
    mgmt: add support for get_connections command
    mgmt: add support for connect failed event
    Fix management remove key command code
    Add support for disconnect management command
    mgmt: Add support for connected/disconnected events
    mgmt: add initial support for link key handling
    Update Class of Device handling to the latest management interface
    
    This patch updates the class of device handling code to match the latest
    management interface. A notable feature is that UUID to service class
    mapping policy remains in user space with the help of the svc_hint
    parameter of the add_uuid command. This is to make it easy to update the
    mapping table when new profiles come along.
    mgmt: Add preliminary UUID handling
    
    This patch adds support for the add_uuid and remove_uuid management
    commands. The kernel uses them to track the list of UUIDs and
    automatically set the service class bits as well as the EIR value
    accordingly.
    mgmt: Implement set_pairable
    
    This patch implements support for the set_pairable managment command.
    Due to the async nature of it a new btd_adapter_pairable_changed
    function is added to the core daemon.
    Update mgmt-api.txt to match latest implementation
    Change power_on & power_off adapter_ops callbacks to set_powered
    
    The current idea is to have a single set_powered management command
    which for the switching on case would leave the controller in a
    non-connectable, non-pairable and non-discoverable state.
    Implement support for management powered event
    Update mgmt-api.txt to match current implementation of read_info
    Update mgmt-api.txt to match current implementation
    Update mgmt-api.txt to match current implementation
    Update mgmt-api.txt to match current implementation
    Add initial Bluetooth Management API doc
    doc/advertisement-monitor-api: Rename methods and shorten the preset strings
    
    This renames RegisterApplication/UnregisterApplication to
    RegisterMonitor/UnregisterMonitor and shortens the strings used in some
    properties.
    doc: Add Advertisement Monitoring API
    
    This patch proposes an Advertisement Monitoring API for an application
    to register a job of monitoring ADV reports with content filter and
    RSSI thresholds.

    adapter: Add btd_request_authorization_cable_configured()
    
    Add btd_request_authorization_cable_configured() function to allow
    cable configured devices to ask the user straight away about whether the
    device should be allowed to connect to the computer.
    
    This allows us to ask the user at the time of the USB connection and
    initial setup, rather than when the first Bluetooth connection is made.
    
    The fact that the device might not be connected to the adapter when
    this event is triggered is mentioned in the Agent API docs.
    agent: Change default IO capability to KeyboardDisplay
    
    The intention of the DisplayYesNo default capability was originally to
    provide the richest possible option available. However with LE there
    is a new even more capable option, namely KeyboardDisplay. When
    applied to BR/EDR connections this gets implicitly downgraded to
    DisplayYesNo since KeyboardDisplay is LE-specific.

    doc/mesh-api: Add dictionary to model properties
    
    This changes the signature of "Models" and "VendorModels" properties
    on org.bluez.mesh.Element1 interface to contain a dictionary with
    model options.
    
    Models: signature change "aq" -> "a(qa{sv})"
    VendorModels: signature change "a(qq)" -> "a(qqa{sv})"
    
    Currently, the defined keywords for the options dictionary are
    "Publish" - indicates whether the model supports publication mechanism.
                If not present, publication is enabled.
    "Subscribe" - indicates whether the model supports subscription mechanism.
                If not present, subscriptions are enabled.
    
    The dictionary allowed to be empty.
    mesh: Replace BeaconFlags with just IvUpdate
    
    To import nodes, applications need just IvIndex and IvUpdate. KeyRefresh
    phase in under provisioner's control, so we don't need to expose it.
    
    Moreover, BeaconFlags property dealt just with the primary net key, and
    each subnet key is refreshed separately.
    mesh: Rename IVUpdate import flag to IvUpdate
    
    Name change for consistency with "IvIndex" property.
    mesh: Add "node is busy" check for Leave() & Attach()
    
    This introduces the following behavior change for those methods
    on Network interface that specify node token as an input parameter
    
    Leave() method:
    If Leave method is called for a node that is being processed as a result
    of a Create, Import, Join or Attach method calls in progress, node removal
    is not allowed and org.bluez.mesh.Error.Busy error is returned.
    
    Attach() method:
    If Attach method is called for a node that is being processed as a result
    of a Create, Import or Join method calls in progress, node attachment
    is not allowed and org.bluez.mesh.Error.Busy error is returned.
    mesh: Make "Busy" and "InProgress" to be distinct errors
    
    This separates "Busy" and "InProgress" error codes:
    MESH_ERROR_IN_PROGRESS maps to org.bluez.mesh.Error.InProgress
    MESH_ERROR_BUSY maps to org.bluez.mesh.Error.Busy
    
    Minor API change:
    UpdateAppKey() returns "InProgress" error instead of "Busy"
    doc/mesh: Change API to deliver tokens via JoinComplete
    
    If Application is not be able to reliably store the token, the daemon
    will end up with a uncontrollable node in its database.
    
    Let's fix the issue by always delivering tokens using JoinComplete call,
    and expecting a reply - if the application return an error, daemon will
    get rid of the node.
    doc/mesh-api: OOB Information field is 16 bit, not 32
    doc/mesh-api: Forward compatibility modifications
    
    The following methods are modified to allow for future development:
    
    Interface org.bluez.mesh.Management1:
    
    Old: void UnprovisionedScan(uint16 seconds)
    New: void UnprovisionedScan(dict options)
    
        The options parameter is a dictionary with the following keys defined:
        uint16 Seconds
                    Specifies number of seconds for scanning to be active.
                    If set to 0 or if this key is not present, then the
                    scanning will continue until UnprovisionedScanCancel()
                    or AddNode() methods are called.
        other keys TBD
    
    Old: void AddNode(array{byte}[16] uuid)
    New: void AddNode(array{byte}[16] uuid, dict options)
    
        The options parameter is currently an empty dictionary
    
    Interface org.bluez.mesh.Provisioner1
    
    Old: void ScanResult(int16 rssi, array{byte} data)
    New: void ScanResult(int16 rssi, array{byte} data, dict options)
    
        The options parameter is currently an empty dictionary
    doc/mesh-api: Fix reference discrepancy for Import()
    
    Remove mentioning of ImportLocalNode() method, use Import() instead.
    mesh: Add sequence nr getter to the doc
    mesh: Fix getting managed objects from ObjectManager
    
    D-Bus spec mandates that GetManagedObjects method of
    org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager interface returns *children* only:
    
    https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html
    > All returned object paths are children of the object path implementing
    > this interface, i.e. their object paths start with the ObjectManager's
    > object path plus '/'
    
    Both test scripts and ELL abuse this by returning application interfaces
    via ObjectManager attached to the same path, but other D-Bus
    implementations do not, making Attach() fail because mandatory
    interfaces cannot be found.
    
    This patch fixes the issue by scanning hierarchy returned by
    GetManagedObjects for object implementing org.bluez.mesh.Application1
    interface and keeping that as node's app_path.
    mesh: Inform application about model subscriptions
    mesh: Provide destination address in MessageReceived API
    mesh: Add remote boolean to DevKey transactions
    
    DevKey operations require authorization on the part of the applications
    making the requests. Messages to state changing Servers should use
    device keys from the remote (destination) to demonstrate authorization.
    doc: Remove uneeded dbus API for App Key Refresh
    mesh: Add org.bluez.mesh.Node1.Addresses property
    
    To enable applications to talk to the local node's internal models, it's
    useful to know its unicast addresses. They are known after CreateNetwork
    and Import, but after Join, the allocated address is only known to the
    provisioner.
    
    This patch enables read only access to list of allocated unicast
    addresses.
    mesh: Add documentation for Import() D-Bus API
    
    This replaces previously specified ImportLocalNode() call
    doc/mesh-api: Restore properties in mesh node hierarchy
    
    This restores Features, Beacon, BeaconFlags, IvIndex and
    SecondsSinceLAst heard properties under the
    org.bluez.mesh.Node1 interface.
    mesh: Check address range passed to ImportRemoteNode
    
    +changed "not authorized" error to "invalid args" when managing device
    key for local address range
    doc: Cleanup API Provisioner1 interface
    
    Modified the RequestProvData In and Out param list to eliminate
    parameters which can be provided by the Node which owns the
    procedure, and clean-up the actual error list.
    mesh: Allow to set-up the CRPL with application
    
    This adds an optional CRPL property to org.bluez.mesh.Application1
    interface, allowing to indicate the depth of reply protection list.
    mesh: Remove unused error code from Leave()
    
    This removes NotFound error from mesh-api.txt from Leave() function.
    mesh: Add new method for Key Refresh procedure
    
    This adds a new method CompleteAppKeyUpdate() on
    org.bluez.mesh.Management1 interface to be used by the application
    at the completion of a Key Refresh procedure. This method should
    be called for each app key that is being updated during the
    procedure, and must be performed prior to changing the phase of
    the bound net key to phase 3.
    mesh: Use node uuids as storage directory names
    
    Instead of keeping track of unique 16bit node identifiers, reuse their
    UUIDs to create both storage directories and dbus objects.
    
    Because of that:
     - UUID is no longer stored in the JSON file, it's inferred from the
       directory name instead
     - Join(), CreateNetwork() and ImportLocalNode() APIs return an error if
       given UUID already registered within the daemon
    mesh: Add APIs for Provisioner and Config Client
    
    The added D-Bus APIs enable Applications to function in a Provisioner
    Initiator role, and as a Configuration Client.
    mesh: Allow only one app attachment per node
    
    If a node is already attached to an application process,
    disallow another appication to attach to the same node.
    This means that an Attach() method called with the token
    identifying a node that is already in use, returns an error
    org.bluez.mesh.Error.AlreadyExists
    doc/mesh-api: Fix Attach() method signature
    
    Correct return arguments for Attach() method.
    Also, fix some grammar and formatting.
    doc: Update mesh Agent API
    
    Change enumerated values to strings in method parameters, and
    corrected formatting for 80 character terminals.
    doc: Initial Bluetooth Mesh API
    
    This decribes proposed D-Bus based API for Bluetooth Mesh
    implementation.
    doc/media-api: Add documentation for DelayReporting
    
    The code was expecting the endpoint to expose
    MediaEndpoint.DelayReporting property in order to expose
    MediaTransport.Delay property.
    doc/media-api: Add RegisterApplication method
    
    This uses application ObjectManager to discover the MediaEndpoint and
    MediaPlayer object of an application and deprecates the use of
    RegisterEndpoint and RegisterPlayer.
    doc/media-api: Add Device property to MediaEndpoint
    
    This adds Device property which indicates which device the endpoint
    belongs to.
    doc/media-api: Add Endpoint property to MediaTransport
    
    Adds endpoint object to MediaTransport so application can resolve which
    MediaEndpoint is in use.
    doc/media-api: Enable MediaEndpoint to expose remote SEP
    
    This adds the possibility to expose remote SEP using MediaEndpoint
    interface to allow setting a configuration.
    doc/media-api: Add Player property to MediaControl1
    
    Player property is use to inform the current addressed player which is
    necessary in case more than one player is available.
    
    This is also remove the deprecated status of MediaControl1 and instead
    deprecated just its methods which similar functionality have been moved
    to MediaPlayer1.
    doc/media-api: Remove obsolete properties
    
    Properties related to HFP/HSP are no longer available since BlueZ has
    no native support of those profiles.
    audio/media: Remove experimental status from Media* interfaces
    
    These interfaces have been stable for a while so there is no reason to
    keep them as experimental anymore.
    doc/media-api: Include possible errors
    doc/media-api: Add Metadata property to MediaItem
    
    The implementation uses a single property to expose the item metadata
    not multiple for every single metadata entry.
    doc/media-api: Update documentation of MediaItem1
    
    This adds documentation of property Player
    doc/media-api: Update documentation of MediaFolder1
    
    This adds missing access types to properties NumberOfItems and Name
    doc/media-api: Update documentation of MediaPlayer1
    
    This adds documentation of properties Type and Subtype
    media-api: Fix mentioning MediaLibrary instead of MediaFolder
    player: Add Playlist property
    
    Playlist property refer to the folder where the list of items being
    played can be found.
    media: Rework MediaItem Type property
    
    Type now can assume the value "folder" so it is no longer necessary to
    have Folder property, FolderType in introduced to provide the folder type
    that before was on the Type itself.
    
    In addition to this add proper documentation what properties are optional
    and under what condition they are available.
    media-api: Fix referencing to MediaLibrary instead of MediaFolder
    
    MediaLibrary was replaced by MediaFolder so doesn't exist anymore.
    media-api: Add org.bluez.MediaFolder1
    
    This interface adds support for browsing and searching in the player's
    storage using AVRCP 1.4/1.5.
    
    Some remarks about the design:
    
      - Exposing UIDCounter and UIDs was considered, but the spec seems to have
        missed to define the player's id persistency. There are also the fact that
        UIDCounter alone does not guarantee persistency across sessions and do not
        provide what exact items have changed, so in the end exposing these
        details will bring almost no value.
      - Indexing or caching the whole media library is not recommended, Bluetooth
        is too slow for that and even vendors such as Apple do not recommend doing
        it, so the only items keep in cache are the current listed ones.
      - Addressed vs Browsed player is done implicitly when accessed, this was done
        to simplify the API and avoid confusions between applications and players.
    media-api: Change RegisterPlayer to use MPRIS spec
    
    RegisterPlayer now expect registered paths to implement
    org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.player interface accourding to MPRIS spec:
    
    http://specifications.freedesktop.org/mpris-spec/latest/
    player: Add Device property
    
    Device property indicates which device object the player belongs to.
    player: Fix documentation to use TrackNumber in track metadata
    
    Using Track key inside a Track property would be pointless, despite the
    documentation and code where also inconsistent.
    media-api: Add playback control methods to MediaPlayer1
    
    This adds methods such as Play, Pause directly in MediaPlayer1, in
    addition to that Track is now turn into a property to take advantage of
    ObjectManager and document the interface as experimental.
    media: Clarify Acquire/TryAcquire error cases
    
    Document the reported errors for Acquire() and TryAcquire(). For the
    later, make sure a specific error in guaranteed for the typical scenario
    of audio not streaming.
    media: Add HFP/HSP gains to transport API

    media: Add version suffix to all media interfaces
    
    Append the version number to all D-Bus interface names in the Media API.
    media: Add MediaTransport.TryAcquire()
    
    Split the Acquire() method in two parts so that the optional acquires,
    formerly represented as a "?" flag in the accesstype parameter of
    Acquire(), are now implemented in TryAcquire().
    media: Remove transport access type from D-Bus API
    
    There is no known use-case making use of these access types and
    therefore the Media API can be simplified.
    
    From now on, the transport will always be acquired with read and write
    access rights.

    doc: Fix typo in media API
    media: Extend media API with optional acquire
    
    Acquiring a transport is needed in two different situations: either
    we are initiating the audio stream locally, or the remote side initiated
    it and thus we are just reacting. In the second case, we would expect
    the stream is already available, and otherwise the operation should
    fail. This means the media API needs to be extended in order to make
    this difference.
    
    This issue is specially relevant in the case of SCO, because the current
    approach is racy. With HFP, for example (say BlueZ has the HS role), the
    following race condition could be met:
    
    1. Phone has an incoming call and thus starts in-band ringing.
    2. SCO connection is accepted and stablished by BlueZ.
    3. Gateway interface state is changed to Playing.
    4. Exactly afterwards, the user routes the audio to the phone, to have
       a private conversation. So the SCO link is closed.
    5. In parallel, PulseAudio sees the transition to Playing, and acquires
       the transport.
    6. BlueZ receives an Acquire() request, but SCO is down. So it tries to
       reconnect the SCO link.
    
    The last step is an undesired behavior (the audio is routed back to the
    car). BlueZ should be smart enough to know that the SCO connection
    shouldn't be reestablished, but this is only possible if the endpoint
    provides additional information in the media API.
    
    Note that the API change introduced by this patch is backward
    compatible, meaning that older versions of BlueZ will just ignore the
    flag. So clients are encouraged to use it without necessarily adding a
    dependency to newer versions of BlueZ.
    media: Expose transport state in D-Bus
    
    Extend the Media API to expose the transport state in D-Bus, as a
    property of the transport. This way the clients do not have to find
    out which is the corresponding profile-specific interface for the
    transport.
    
    Additionally, this state along with the automatic release of transports
    will allow clients to avoid the "optional release" or "accept remote
    release" race condition. For example, with HSP/HFP profiles, the problem
    is the following:
    
    1. User suspends SCO in the remote end.
    2. BlueZ signals the Playing->Connected state change in D-Bus.
    3. Exactly afterwards, the user resumes SCO in the remote end.
    4. In parallel, PulseAudio sees the aforementioned transition to
       Connected, and thus releases the transport.
    5. BlueZ receives a Release() request while SCO is up. So the audio
       stream will be suspended.
    
    The last step is an undesired behavior since the user explicitly wanted
    to route the audio stream through Bluetooth.
    
    The issue is difficult to reproduce but it can easily be solved by
    exposing the transport state in D-Bus.

    Don't overwrite metadata when changing track
    
    If we use the same hash table to set the new metadata, we have 2
    undesired behaviors:

    the fields
    2) If we fail on parsing the signal, we will still change some of the
    fields

    AVRCP: move MediaPlayer to adapter object
    
    This move the MediaPlayer registration to adapter object on Media
    interface so we can track players properly.
    Update Media API documentation
    
    Possible error responses are added to RegisterEndpoint.
    Add Routing property to MediaTransport interface
    
    This should indicate to the endpoint what routing the transport is using
    Remove IMTU and OMTU properties and return its values on Acquire reply
    
    This should make Acquire blocking friendly since the client no longer has
    to call GetProperties to discover how much it can write/read when using
    the acquired file descriptor.
    Make MediaEndpoint.ClearConfiguration to take transport path
    
    This makes simpler to application which are handling many endpoints
    without a context data. It also may be useful in future in case we
    allow multiple transports per endpoint.
    Make MediaEndpoint.SetConfiguration to take all transport properties
    
    This will probably avoid the endpoint agent to have to call GetProperties
    to check for transport properties.
    Add media API documentation
    
    Media API is a replacement for the internal audio IPC which is no longer
    necessary as DBus 1.3 and newer are capable of transfering file

    doc: Remove Profile1.Cancel() method
    
    There does not seem to be any actual need for this method.
    
    The current implementation calls Cancel when a pending
    NewConnection() or RequestDisconnection() method call fails.
    Additionally it calls Cancel() when the remote client has disconnected.
    In either case BlueZ calls shutdown on the file descriptor associated
    with the agent and issues a Cancel() method call.
    
    The closing of the file descriptor will trigger a HUP on the agent side,
    which will trigger normal cleanup procedures.  The received Cancel()
    method call is redundant in both cases.
    doc: Label Profile1.Release() method as no reply
    
    The current implementation does not expect a reply, nor would it make
    sense for BlueZ to wait for one from the agent.  So explicitly label
    this method as noreply.

    This patch updates Thermometer API document to reflect changes in

    thermometer: Fix handling of missing Temperature Type
    
    According to HTS 1.0 (Table 3.1, and Sections 3.1.1.4 and 3.2), the
    Temperature Type Characteristic is optional. The only restriction is
    that it shall not be present if the Temperature Type is non-static, for
    which case the "Temperature Type" field shall be present on the
    Temperature Measurement Characteristic value.
    
    Given there is no default value specified when the Temperature Type is
    static and unknown, the "Type" entry for MeasurementReceived() on the
    Thermometer API was made optional.

    gatt: Fix not allowing 'extended-properties' as flags

    The option "type" can be used to force a certain procedure to be used:

      - "request": Use (Long) Write With Response procedure
      - "reliable"" Use Reliable Write procedure
    doc/gatt-api: Add Handle property
    
    When acting as server it is useful to select where to allocate the
    handle for an attribute so it can be restored in the same position when
    restarting the daemon or rebooting the system.
    
    In order to do that the application also needs to know in which handle
    the attribute is allocated the very first time it is registered, this
    also allows for a better integration with PTS and tools like auto-pts
    which needs to know the handles where the attributes have been
    allocated.

    "The Read Blob Request is repeated until the Read Blob Response’s Part
    Attribute Value parameter is zero or an Error Response is sent by the server
    with the Error Code set to Invalid Offset." Bluetooth Core 5.0, 4.12.2
    
    "If the prepare Value Offset is greater than the current length of the attribute
    value then all pending prepare write values shall be discarded for this client,
    the queue shall be cleared and then an Error Response shall be sent with the
    «Invalid Offset»." Bluetooth Core 5.0, 3.4.6.3
    doc/gatt-api.txt: Add support for Included Service

    doc/gatt-api: Add link option
    
    This adds link option to ReadValue and WriteValue so the application
    can determine which bearer the request is coming from.
    doc/gatt-api: Add server support for AcquireWrite and AcquireNotify
    
    This enables servers to use the same mechanism to use packet based IO
    using file descriptors bypassing D-Bus.
    
    Note that the application is free to choose any type of medium that can
    use file descriptors, thus this is not limited to pipe2 although that is
    probably recommended due its simplicity.
    doc/gatt-api: Add Confirm
    
    Add Confirm method which doesn't expect a reply so it is just
    confirmation that value was received.
    client: Add release-notify command
    
    This adds release-notify command which closes an existing fd unlocking
    the attribute:
    
    [Test peripheral:/service001f/char0020]# release-notify
    [CHG] Attribute /org/bluez/hci1/dev_69_16_5B_9A_06_CD/service001f/char0020 NotifyAcquired: no
    doc/gatt-api: Add AcquireWrite and AcquireNotify
    
    This enables write and notify exclusive access via file descriptors in
    case the characteristic is actually trying to emulate a byte stream
    transfer or have a protocol on top of GATT.

    Since RegisterApplication makes use of ObjectManager it is also possible
    to verify the existance of GattProfile objects unifying the API for both
    services (GATT server) and profiles (GATT client).
    doc/gatt-api: Add options dictionary to ReadValue/WriteValue
    
    This adds the possibility to pass an offset to these operations, and
    also in the server case to give the device object.
    doc/gatt-api: Make Notifying property optional
    
    If the characteristic does not support nofications nor indications the
    Notifying property can be omitted as it will never going to be used.
    doc/gatt-api: Remove Characteristics and Descriptors properties
    
    These properties are no longer needed since the objects shall be managed
    with use of ObjectManager both in case of client and server.
    doc/gatt-api: Make proper use of ObjectManager
    
    ObjectManager path shall not contain other intefaces in its root path, only
    child objects shall be included with many bindings following this.
    
    Due to this limitation and also the fact that application might actually
    have a single ObjectManager path so all services can be registered at
    once.
    doc/gatt-api: Add Flags property to GattDescriptor
    
    This adds Flags property to GattDescriptor so the server can define
    permissions and authentication requirements for descriptors.
    doc/gatt-api: Add encryption flags
    
    This add encryption flags which can be used when registering a service to
    require encryption when accessing a characteristic.
    doc/gatt-api.txt: New ObjectManager requirements
    
    After some discussion it was decided to require an ObjectManager
    interface implementation on a per-service basis to reduce the
    overhead of heaving to process and cache potentially many non-GATT
    related objects. This patch updates the documentation to reflect this.
    doc/gatt-api: Introduce GattProfile1 concept
    
    Until now the GATT D-Bus API doesn't provide any way to register client
    role profiles so that bluetoothd would be able to add matching devices
    to its auto-connect list (managed by the kernel from 3.17 onward). To
    keep the GATT D-Bus interface as capable as the internal plugin API this
    patch adds a new concept of a GattProfile1 D-Bus object. By registering
    such an object and providing a set of mandatory service UUIDs bluetoothd
    will start performing matching against remote devices and add them to
    the auto-connect list.
    doc/gatt-api: Update to match latest plans
    doc/gatt-api.txt: Update error names
    
    Updated possible error names that can be returned from
    ReadValue/WriteValue methods to match those currently returned from the
    experimental implementation.
    doc/gatt-api: New API properties and methods for the GATT D-Bus API.
    
    This patch introduces the following new properties to the GattService1
    interface:
    
      Device: A remote-service-only property that contains the D-Bus object
      path of the associated device.
    
      Primary: Reflects whether or not a services is primary or secondary.
    
    This patch also introduces new methods to GattCharacteristic1 and
    GattDescriptor1 for reading and writing the corresponding attribute
    values and a new signal for being notified of received notifications and
    indications.
    
    The "Value" D-Bus property is removed from both interfaces
    and replaced with asynchronous ReadValue and WriteValue functions. This
    is due to the fact that DBus.Properties.Get is synchronous and without
    an asynchronous way of issuing a GATT value read request, there are
    cases where a single read and cache based approach becomes limiting
    (e.g. when a characteristic allows reads but no notifications) and
    relying on the PropertyChanged signal to retrieve the value of a read
    request asynchonously as well as to signal notifications/indications
    makes for a vague API.
    doc: Add InvalidArguments to UnregisterService() errors

    gatt: Add support for storing Service Changed CCC value
    
    This adds support for storing CCC value of Service Changed
    characteristic. Once bluetoothd is restart stored values are read
    and any device subscribed to indications will receive Service Changed
    indication with 0x00010-0xffff value. This is to invalidate any
    non-core services since there is no way to verify if applications
    will register their services in same order (or at all).
    
    This fix accessing invalid handles by stacks that rely only on Service
    Changed indication for rediscovery ie. Apple iOS.
    doc: Add definition of a new addresses file
    
    Currently bluetoothd doesn't support single-mode adapters without a
    public address. This patch defines a new 'addresses' file that will be
    used for managing generated static random addresses.
    core/adapter: Add support for enabling privacy
    
    This adds support for loading local IRK key when adapter is configured.
    In case IRK is not present new key is generated and stored.
    In case of errors privacy is explicitly disabled. We ensure that we
    memset IRK to zero before disabling privacy.
    IRK is stored in %s/identity file. Privacy setting is configured
    globally in main.conf. In the future we may add per device
    configuration in %s/settings.
    doc/settings-storage: Add alternative format for descriptors
    
    In case of some descriptors like CEP we must store the actual value since
    extended properties are not part of the discovery and btd_gatt_client no

    In case DatabaseIdentifier is present the user application can then
    request the folder version via GetVersion.
