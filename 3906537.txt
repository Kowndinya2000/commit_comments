    Added Translation to hr/auth.php
    
    This correction added a correct Croatian translation
    instead of the english ones that were in the auth.php script.
    Users of this code will therefore not have to change/modify
    these manually as they are already correct.
    This prevents from showing unwanted translations and

    Grammar mistake in passwords.php
    
    In Ukrainian, genitive case of the word "–ø–∞—Ä–æ–ª—å" should be "–ø–∞—Ä–æ–ª—ñ–≤" (see [Wiktionary](https://uk.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D0%BF%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C#.D0.9C.D0.BE.D1.80.D1.84.D0.BE.D0.BB.D0.BE.D0.B3.D1.96.D1.87.D0.BD.D1.96_.D1.82.D0.B0_.D1.81.D0.B8.D0.BD.D1.82.D0.B0.D0.BA.D1.81.D0.B8.D1.87.D0.BD.D1.96_.D0.B2.D0.BB.D0.B0.D1.81.D1.82.D0.B8.D0.B2.D0.BE.D1.81.D1.82.D1.96)) instead of Russian "–ø–∞—Ä–æ–ª–µ–π" (see [Wiktionary](https://uk.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D0%BF%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C#.D0.9C.D0.BE.D1.80.D1.84.D0.BE.D0.BB.D0.BE.D0.B3.D1.96.D1.87.D0.BD.D1.96_.D1.82.D0.B0_.D1.81.D0.B8.D0.BD.D1.82.D0.B0.D0.BA.D1.81.D0.B8.D1.87.D0.BD.D1.96_.D0.B2.D0.BB.D0.B0.D1.81.D1.82.D0.B8.D0.B2.D0.BE.D1.81.D1.82.D1.96_2))

    Changed to use "conter" in all sentences, some phrases needed to be changed to be able to use this word but now also specify the type expected for the input field, for example "deve conter um n√∫mero entre" specifies that the field actually expects a number.
    Wrong tense
    
    Some of the validation errors are actually in the future tense (weird). "dever√°" changed to "deve".
    Also small fixes on some sentences.
    And fixes on the use of the word "conter" and "ter" the first is a property inside something the second is a property of something.
    Also changed the array validation to return "array" instead of "conjunto" it's better since we don't use this word often in brazil, also the string validation is currently returning "string" instead of "cadeia de caracteres" so now both have the same aproach.

    German: add ends_with, general gramattical changes to make it more native souding
    
    Hi,
    
    this PR provides a translation for `ends_with` and also changes various other translations to make them sound more native. Also, messages are changed to be coherent (e.g. use `muss ausgef√ºllt werden` for all `required_` fields instead of different phrases).
    feature: add validation.ends_with and todo updated
    Add missing translations (Done by Cover Genius)
    feature: validation date_equals and starts_with
    [de] Added translation for UUID
    The todo list says that a translation is needed for the field `Name` in json.
    In German, `Name` is written in the same way as in English, so this entry will be in the todo list.
    feature: uuid
    fix: #938 with min, max and values

    Fix comparison (grammar) in the german translation.
    
    2nd step/level of gro√ü is gr√∂√üer; not gro√üer
    Remove articles in the german translation.
    
    'Das' cannot be applied universally.
    
    Example: Der Bild konnte nicht hochgeladen werden.
    
    This is plainfully wrong, correct would be: Das Bild konnte nicht hochgeladen werden.
    
    To avoid this issue for good, just remove the article altogether and make it more neutral.

    Translations added for gt, gte, lt, lte
    
    Translations added for gt,gte,lt,lte. Tried to keep it similar to existing translations.
    Also changed ```kilobytes``` to ```kilobyte``` (s-endings are not used to indicate plural in Norwegian).
    Max-rule for files is wrong
    
    If I translate the current Norwegian max-rule for strings back to English, it reads:
    ```:attribute must not be shorter than :max characters```
    ... which is the exact opposite of what this validation error text is meant to convey. After the change, it will translate to:
    ```:attribute must not be greater than :max characters```

    Fix Dutch 'underscore' translation
    
    In Dutch, 'liggend streepje' is a dash, see https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liggend_streepje_(leesteken).
    I think it is common to just use 'underscore' in Dutch (https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underscore).

    Dutch translation for in_array
    feature: validation - in_array
    feature: validation - distinct
    feature: validation - add present
    Changed confusing Dutch phrasing for required_unless
    
    The Dutch phrase is confusing, it will say:
    ``admin password is verplicht tenzij rol voorkomt in admin, moderator``
    (``admin password is required unless role occurs in admin, moderator``)
    
    Whereas this makes more sense:
    ``admin password is verplicht tenzij rol gelijk is aan admin, moderator``
    (``admin password is required unless role is equal to admin, moderator``)
    Fixing the Coding Style
    Fixed "required_unless"
    Translated 'required_unless' to dutch
    Clear translation of 'characters'.
    
    Clear translation of 'characters'. Where 'karakters' is used before, 'karakters' should be used here too in stead of 'characters'.
    feature: add validation.required_unless
    Fix cording standard.
    Corrected 'format' to 'formaat'
    
    Changed 'format' to 'formaat' in the regex validation string.
    Fix dutch 'max' translations
    
    The max translations stated ':attribute must be less than :max'. This is incorrect as it should be 'can't be more than :max'.

    'timezone' position.

    Normalize translation rules
    
    When using custom validation attributes it's very hard to keep field name in an uniform format. Sometimes it starts with :attribute, another time it's inside or at the end of the message. For example:
    
    ```php
    'attributes' => [
            'password' => 'has≈Ço',
    ],
    ```
    with regex and min rules:
    
    ```
    Format has≈Ço jest nieprawid≈Çowy. #regex, sounds strange in polish, stylistically incorrect
    has≈Ço musi mieƒá przynajmniej 8 znak√≥w. #min, starts with lower letter
    ```
    
    With modified messages:
    
    ```
    Format pola has≈Ço jest nieprawid≈Çowy.
