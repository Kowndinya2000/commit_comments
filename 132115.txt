    As discussed with Seth, to better interoperate with development tools
    like Berkshelf and Test Kitchen, the metadata should have the name of
    the cookbook as the "name" attribute. Also, so that this works with
    riak-cs properly, the :start action should be specified for the riak
    service.

    Prepare VM arguments using the hash value of node.riak.erlang
    
    Since Chef uses "Mashes" which aren't actually Hashes, some of the Riak
    configuration turned to strings were "<Chef::Node::Attribute>" objects.
    By calling `to_hash` it turns it into a hash which is what the libraries
    expect.

    package and libssl 0.9.8 dependency.

    Fix conditional order
    Fix Riak EE download URL following 2.1 release
    
    While I'd prefer that #170 be merged, in order to speed things along in case there's concern about the version bump, here's an alternative patch with only the part that fixes the broken Riak EE download URL.
    
    For posterity: The difference between the URLs is that the new one omits the `major_minor` part of the path.
    Foodcritic probably shouldn't throw FC002 for this case but I'll apease it anyway
