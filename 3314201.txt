    Added checkbox for disabling "replies to inbox" when replying to comments (#543)
    
    When replying to comments, it's now possible to disable that replies will be sent to the inbox. (Potential improvement: preference for default behaviour)
    
    Reddit's API endpoint /sendreplies is used for this.
    About the actual implementation, I'm not sure if it would be more elegant to move the actual call into CommentReplyActivity, but then we have to escalate the id of the newly created post, which would entail some refactoring.
    
    On another note, Reddit's API responses surely have to be a joke, right? No sane person could do that...

    Tidying things up
    Add preference for configuring cache location (#370)
    
    This allows you to chose from the internal storage and all external storage locations.
    Changing the location will not migrate existing cache files, but they will still be
    loaded from the old location (and will exentually be pruned).
    
    This also removes the external storage permission for API 19 and above, since
    it's no longer required for the app-specific external storage directories.

    Added setting for self-post collapse (#503)
    
    It was requested on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/RedReader/comments/6bv9ma/an_option_to_turn_off_collapsing_of_selfposts_on/
    
    For now, one can choose between collapsing the text or doing nothing, but it can be (almost) trivially extended to support more actions.
    
    One might also want to refactor the self-post code in the future to be treated the same as a comment in some cases.

    * Added block, pin and subscribe actions to RedditPreparedPost's context menu
    
    Similiar to #458, I added menu items to (un)subscribe to a subreddit,
    (un)block and (un)pin it, depending on its current state.
    
    It's only activated when the subreddit's name is displayed.
    
    This should help satisfy #475.
    
    * "pin", "subscribe", "block" items are now automatically enabled

    Added share/open option to the WebView's option menu (#449)
    
    as requested in Issue #441
    Added Context Menu for links
    
    Long-pressing on a link button now shows a context menu with following actions:
    * Copy URL to clipboard
    * Share URL
    * Open URL in external browser
    
    In case a link is an image, two additional actions are available:
    * Save Image
    * Share Image
    
    The actions are configurable through the menu preferences.
    
    I moved some image-and-permission-related code from RedditPreparedPost into own classes to make it better reusable.
    Updated german l18n (#447)
    Added post fling action preference for "go back"
    Basic support for /r/popular
    Private message replies are now part of the original conversion, rather than starting a new one (fixes #442)
    Fixed non-reddit 403 message
    Issue #413 - share image directly (#418)
    
    * Issue #413 - share image directly
    
    * Share image intent title.
    
    * Only show "Share image" entry if post.mIsProbablyAnImage
    
    * Saving file to storage before creating Intent
    
    Even with intent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION),
    Whatsapp wouldn't accept the intent. Maybe they ignore mimetype
    and only look into file extension?
    
    This does the same as "Save image", but then shares said file.
    Multiple shares of the same file will repeatedly save the file.

    Tidying things up
    Add preference for configuring cache location (#370)
    
    This allows you to chose from the internal storage and all external storage locations.
    Changing the location will not migrate existing cache files, but they will still be
    loaded from the old location (and will exentually be pruned).
    
    This also removes the external storage permission for API 19 and above, since
    it's no longer required for the app-specific external storage directories.
    Fixed file permissions
    Share post comments as permalink (#367)
    
    * Adding option to share post's comments as permalink (URL with post title)

    Added checkbox for disabling "replies to inbox" when replying to comments (#543)
    
    When replying to comments, it's now possible to disable that replies will be sent to the inbox. (Potential improvement: preference for default behaviour)
    
    Reddit's API endpoint /sendreplies is used for this.
    About the actual implementation, I'm not sure if it would be more elegant to move the actual call into CommentReplyActivity, but then we have to escalate the id of the newly created post, which would entail some refactoring.
    
    On another note, Reddit's API responses surely have to be a joke, right? No sane person could do that...

    * Enabling fullscreen video in the internal browser
    
    fixes #504
    Thanks to @japanesephundroid for providing a link to the solution.
    I ported @cprcrack's work on video enabled WebViews to the
    current implementation, the code was taken from
    https://github.com/cprcrack/VideoEnabledWebView .
    I successfully tested viewing video both normally and in fullscreen
    in OxygenOS Beta 25, which runs on Android 8.0.
    Due to emulator problems, I wasn't able to test any other version of
    Android, so I think this PR has to be tested thoroughly before merging,
    especially on custom ROMs and different phone OEMs' implementations.

    Add search option in the "Custom Location" dialog (#574)
    
    To search Reddit, users currently must tap a subreddit (eg. /r/all), tap
    the menu icon then select search.
    
    This adds search an option in the "Custom Location" dialog; which
    opens the search page with the query.  It searches all subreddits.

    This is mainly a safeguard, to keep our memory usage constrained, even
    if the users sets the entry maxage to 3 months and looks at a LOT of
    posts/comments/etc. -- but we guesstimate that nobody will actually
    hit that 10k limit (if this should prove to be an issue, the limit
    could also be made configurable).

    It was requested on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/RedReader/comments/6bv9ma/an_option_to_turn_off_collapsing_of_selfposts_on/
    
    For now, one can choose between collapsing the text or doing nothing, but it can be (almost) trivially extended to support more actions.
    
    One might also want to refactor the self-post code in the future to be treated the same as a comment in some cases.

    In case a link is an image, two additional actions are available:
    * Save Image

    The actions are configurable through the menu preferences.

    and only look into file extension?
    
    This does the same as "Save image", but then shares said file.

    This allows you to chose from the internal storage and all external storage locations.
    Changing the location will not migrate existing cache files, but they will still be
    loaded from the old location (and will exentually be pruned).
    
    This also removes the external storage permission for API 19 and above, since
    it's no longer required for the app-specific external storage directories.
    Fixed file permissions

    * Replace space indents with tabs
    
    The project uses tabs, be consistent about it.

    Adding Basque to language list
    Add search option in the "Custom Location" dialog (#574)
    
    To search Reddit, users currently must tap a subreddit (eg. /r/all), tap
    the menu icon then select search.
    
    This adds search an option in the "Custom Location" dialog; which
    opens the search page with the query.  It searches all subreddits.
    Added prefs for new languages
    Updating changelog + adding Indonesian to menu
    Added setting for self-post collapse (#503)
    
    It was requested on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/RedReader/comments/6bv9ma/an_option_to_turn_off_collapsing_of_selfposts_on/
    
    For now, one can choose between collapsing the text or doing nothing, but it can be (almost) trivially extended to support more actions.
    
    One might also want to refactor the self-post code in the future to be treated the same as a comment in some cases.
    Added edit context menu item to self posts  (#478)

    * Added block, pin and subscribe actions to RedditPreparedPost's context menu
    
    Similiar to #458, I added menu items to (un)subscribe to a subreddit,
    (un)block and (un)pin it, depending on its current state.
    
    It's only activated when the subreddit's name is displayed.
    
    This should help satisfy #475.
    
    * "pin", "subscribe", "block" items are now automatically enabled

    Added Context Menu for links
    
    Long-pressing on a link button now shows a context menu with following actions:
    * Copy URL to clipboard
    * Share URL
    * Open URL in external browser
    
    In case a link is an image, two additional actions are available:
    * Save Image
    * Share Image
    
    The actions are configurable through the menu preferences.
    
    I moved some image-and-permission-related code from RedditPreparedPost into own classes to make it better reusable.
    Added comment fling action preference for "go back"
    Added post fling action preference for "go back"
    Issue #413 - share image directly (#418)
    
    * Issue #413 - share image directly
    
    * Share image intent title.
    
    * Only show "Share image" entry if post.mIsProbablyAnImage
    
    * Saving file to storage before creating Intent
    
    Even with intent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION),
    Whatsapp wouldn't accept the intent. Maybe they ignore mimetype
    and only look into file extension?
    
    This does the same as "Save image", but then shares said file.
    Multiple shares of the same file will repeatedly save the file.

    Added Sharing category under Behaviour in settings, moved two options to it, introduced "Include title/description when sharing" option, and localized a couple of hardcoded strings. (#578)
    Make pruning age of entry marks (read, upvoted, etc.) configurable (#567)
    
    * Make pruning age of entry marks (read, upvoted, etc.) configurable
    
    * Limit the total number of cached flag entries
    
    This is mainly a safeguard, to keep our memory usage constrained, even
    if the users sets the entry maxage to 3 months and looks at a LOT of
    posts/comments/etc. -- but we guesstimate that nobody will actually
    hit that 10k limit (if this should prove to be an issue, the limit
    could also be made configurable).
    Added checkbox for disabling "replies to inbox" when replying to comments (#543)
    
    When replying to comments, it's now possible to disable that replies will be sent to the inbox. (Potential improvement: preference for default behaviour)
    
    Reddit's API endpoint /sendreplies is used for this.
    About the actual implementation, I'm not sure if it would be more elegant to move the actual call into CommentReplyActivity, but then we have to escalate the id of the newly created post, which would entail some refactoring.
    
    On another note, Reddit's API responses surely have to be a joke, right? No sane person could do that...
    
    Fixes #286
    Added preference for sharing comments (#538)
    
    When sharing comments, it's now possible to specify whether one wants to include the actual comment text along with the url.
    Added setting for self-post collapse (#503)
    
    It was requested on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/RedReader/comments/6bv9ma/an_option_to_turn_off_collapsing_of_selfposts_on/
    
    For now, one can choose between collapsing the text or doing nothing, but it can be (almost) trivially extended to support more actions.
    
    One might also want to refactor the self-post code in the future to be treated the same as a comment in some cases.
    values: remove non-translatable translations
    
    Makes the newer aapt happy.
    values: remove some empty and unused translations
    Self-posts can now be collapsed (#484)
    
    Clicking on the original text of a self-post now collapses it.
    Added edit context menu item to self posts  (#478)
    
    * Added edit context menu item to self posts
    
    * Updated changelog, "edit" item is now automatically enabled for upgrading users

    Added block, pin and subscribe actions to RedditPreparedPost's context menu (#477)
    
    * Added block, pin and subscribe actions to RedditPreparedPost's context menu
    
    Similiar to #458, I added menu items to (un)subscribe to a subreddit,
    (un)block and (un)pin it, depending on its current state.
    
    It's only activated when the subreddit's name is displayed.
    
    This should help satisfy #475.
    
    * "pin", "subscribe", "block" items are now automatically enabled
    for upgrading users
    
    * Created new strings
    Added context menu to subreddits in mainmenu (#458)

    Change share text
    Added share/open option to the WebView's option menu (#449)
    
    as requested in Issue #441
    Added Context Menu for links
    
    Long-pressing on a link button now shows a context menu with following actions:
    * Copy URL to clipboard
    * Share URL
    * Open URL in external browser
    
    In case a link is an image, two additional actions are available:
    * Save Image
    * Share Image
    
    The actions are configurable through the menu preferences.
    
    I moved some image-and-permission-related code from RedditPreparedPost into own classes to make it better reusable.

    hit that 10k limit (if this should prove to be an issue, the limit
    could also be made configurable).
    Preference to refresh posts every time
    Auto-refresh old post lists (with preference)
    Add preference for configuring cache location (#370)
    
    This allows you to chose from the internal storage and all external storage locations.
    Changing the location will not migrate existing cache files, but they will still be
    loaded from the old location (and will exentually be pruned).
    
    This also removes the external storage permission for API 19 and above, since
    it's no longer required for the app-specific external storage directories.

    Added setting for self-post collapse (#503)
    
    It was requested on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/RedReader/comments/6bv9ma/an_option_to_turn_off_collapsing_of_selfposts_on/
    
    For now, one can choose between collapsing the text or doing nothing, but it can be (almost) trivially extended to support more actions.
    
    One might also want to refactor the self-post code in the future to be treated the same as a comment in some cases.

    This is mainly a safeguard, to keep our memory usage constrained, even
    if the users sets the entry maxage to 3 months and looks at a LOT of
    posts/comments/etc. -- but we guesstimate that nobody will actually
    hit that 10k limit (if this should prove to be an issue, the limit
    could also be made configurable).

    Add preference for configuring cache location (#370)
    
    This allows you to chose from the internal storage and all external storage locations.
    Changing the location will not migrate existing cache files, but they will still be
    loaded from the old location (and will exentually be pruned).
    
    This also removes the external storage permission for API 19 and above, since
    it's no longer required for the app-specific external storage directories.

    The project uses tabs, be consistent about it.
    
    * Take lint suggestion on apply() vs commit()
    
            Consider using apply() instead; commit writes its data to
            persistent storage immediately, whereas apply will handle it in
            the background

    * Make pruning age of entry marks (read, upvoted, etc.) configurable
    
    * Limit the total number of cached flag entries
    
    This is mainly a safeguard, to keep our memory usage constrained, even
    if the users sets the entry maxage to 3 months and looks at a LOT of
    posts/comments/etc. -- but we guesstimate that nobody will actually
    hit that 10k limit (if this should prove to be an issue, the limit
    could also be made configurable).

    * lint: disable MissingTranslation
    
    * Replace space indents with tabs
    
    The project uses tabs, be consistent about it.
    
    * Take lint suggestion on apply() vs commit()
    
            Consider using apply() instead; commit writes its data to
            persistent storage immediately, whereas apply will handle it in
            the background

    Extended long-press context menu to Imgur album viewer
    
    The aforementioned context menu for links now also works for single images in the imgur album viewer.
    Added Context Menu for links
    
    Long-pressing on a link button now shows a context menu with following actions:
    * Copy URL to clipboard
    * Share URL
    * Open URL in external browser
    
    In case a link is an image, two additional actions are available:
    * Save Image
    * Share Image
    
    The actions are configurable through the menu preferences.
    
    I moved some image-and-permission-related code from RedditPreparedPost into own classes to make it better reusable.

    Add preference for configuring cache location (#370)
    
    This allows you to chose from the internal storage and all external storage locations.
    Changing the location will not migrate existing cache files, but they will still be
    loaded from the old location (and will exentually be pruned).
    
    This also removes the external storage permission for API 19 and above, since
    it's no longer required for the app-specific external storage directories.

    Make pruning age of entry marks (read, upvoted, etc.) configurable (#567)
    
    * Make pruning age of entry marks (read, upvoted, etc.) configurable
    
    * Limit the total number of cached flag entries
    
    This is mainly a safeguard, to keep our memory usage constrained, even
    if the users sets the entry maxage to 3 months and looks at a LOT of
    posts/comments/etc. -- but we guesstimate that nobody will actually
    hit that 10k limit (if this should prove to be an issue, the limit
    could also be made configurable).
    Added prefs for new languages
    Added support for /r/random (#549)
    Added preference for sharing comments (#538)
    
    When sharing comments, it's now possible to specify whether one wants to include the actual comment text along with the url.

    * Add popular to main menu
    
    * Make preference for showing /r/popular in main menu
    Added setting for self-post collapse (#503)
    
    It was requested on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/RedReader/comments/6bv9ma/an_option_to_turn_off_collapsing_of_selfposts_on/
    
    For now, one can choose between collapsing the text or doing nothing, but it can be (almost) trivially extended to support more actions.
    
    One might also want to refactor the self-post code in the future to be treated the same as a comment in some cases.
    Added buttons to skip between top-level comments
    gradle: bump pmd to 5.6.0 and make it happy
    Added context menu to subreddits in mainmenu (#458)
    
    * Added context menu to subreddits in mainmenu
    
    * Added block/unblock and pin/unpin to context menu
    
    * Removed obsolete comments, added toasts for (un-)subscription
    Added Context Menu for links
    
    Long-pressing on a link button now shows a context menu with following actions:
    * Copy URL to clipboard
    * Share URL
    * Open URL in external browser
    
    In case a link is an image, two additional actions are available:
    * Save Image
    * Share Image
    
    The actions are configurable through the menu preferences.
    
    I moved some image-and-permission-related code from RedditPreparedPost into own classes to make it better reusable.
    Added comment fling action preference for "go back"

    * addded setting for pinned subreddit sort strategy
    
    * added autoRefresh
    
    * fix typo
    
    * Set summary the RR way
    Add preference for configuring cache location (#370)
    
    This allows you to chose from the internal storage and all external storage locations.
    Changing the location will not migrate existing cache files, but they will still be
    loaded from the old location (and will exentually be pruned).
    
    This also removes the external storage permission for API 19 and above, since
    it's no longer required for the app-specific external storage directories.
    Fixed file permissions
    Share post comments as permalink (#367)
    
    * Adding option to share post's comments as permalink (URL with post title)

    Re-run `gradle wrapper` to update the scripts and jar.

    * Bump support libs to 23.4.0
    
    * Bump netcipher to 1.2.1 minor release

                            } catch(Throwable _) {
                                              ^
              (use of '_' as an identifier might not be supported in releases after Java SE 8)

              (use of '_' as an identifier might not be supported in releases after Java SE 8)
    
    * lint: disable MissingTranslation
    
    * Replace space indents with tabs
    
    The project uses tabs, be consistent about it.
    
    * Take lint suggestion on apply() vs commit()
    
            Consider using apply() instead; commit writes its data to
            persistent storage immediately, whereas apply will handle it in
            the background
    
    * Remove unused white_selector drawable

    fixes #504
    Thanks to @japanesephundroid for providing a link to the solution.
    I ported @cprcrack's work on video enabled WebViews to the
    current implementation, the code was taken from
    https://github.com/cprcrack/VideoEnabledWebView .
    I successfully tested viewing video both normally and in fullscreen
    in OxygenOS Beta 25, which runs on Android 8.0.
    Due to emulator problems, I wasn't able to test any other version of
    Android, so I think this PR has to be tested thoroughly before merging,
    especially on custom ROMs and different phone OEMs' implementations.

    Respect browser preference in internal WebView's (#711)
    Enabling fullscreen video in the internal browser (#540)
    
    * Enabling fullscreen video in the internal browser
    
    fixes #504
    Thanks to @japanesephundroid for providing a link to the solution.
    I ported @cprcrack's work on video enabled WebViews to the
    current implementation, the code was taken from
    https://github.com/cprcrack/VideoEnabledWebView .
    I successfully tested viewing video both normally and in fullscreen
    in OxygenOS Beta 25, which runs on Android 8.0.
    Due to emulator problems, I wasn't able to test any other version of
    Android, so I think this PR has to be tested thoroughly before merging,
    especially on custom ROMs and different phone OEMs' implementations.

    * lint: disable MissingTranslation

    The project uses tabs, be consistent about it.
    
    * Take lint suggestion on apply() vs commit()

            persistent storage immediately, whereas apply will handle it in

    It was requested on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/RedReader/comments/6bv9ma/an_option_to_turn_off_collapsing_of_selfposts_on/
    
    For now, one can choose between collapsing the text or doing nothing, but it can be (almost) trivially extended to support more actions.

    To search Reddit, users currently must tap a subreddit (eg. /r/all), tap
    the menu icon then select search.
    
    This adds search an option in the "Custom Location" dialog; which
    opens the search page with the query.  It searches all subreddits.

    * Saving file to storage before creating Intent
    
    Even with intent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION),
    Whatsapp wouldn't accept the intent. Maybe they ignore mimetype
    and only look into file extension?
    
    This does the same as "Save image", but then shares said file.
    Multiple shares of the same file will repeatedly save the file.

    Added checkbox for disabling "replies to inbox" when replying to comments (#543)
    
    When replying to comments, it's now possible to disable that replies will be sent to the inbox. (Potential improvement: preference for default behaviour)
    
    Reddit's API endpoint /sendreplies is used for this.
    About the actual implementation, I'm not sure if it would be more elegant to move the actual call into CommentReplyActivity, but then we have to escalate the id of the newly created post, which would entail some refactoring.
    
    On another note, Reddit's API responses surely have to be a joke, right? No sane person could do that...

    posts/comments/etc. -- but we guesstimate that nobody will actually
    hit that 10k limit (if this should prove to be an issue, the limit
    could also be made configurable).
    Fixed test failures
    Moved handler from Constants to General
    Removing code for old Android versions (#509)
    
    * Deleted AndroidApi.java
    
    * Deleted AndroidApi.java pt 2
    
    * Removed some unnecessary code
    
    * One more change
    Added setting for self-post collapse (#503)
    
    It was requested on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/RedReader/comments/6bv9ma/an_option_to_turn_off_collapsing_of_selfposts_on/
    
    For now, one can choose between collapsing the text or doing nothing, but it can be (almost) trivially extended to support more actions.
    
    One might also want to refactor the self-post code in the future to be treated the same as a comment in some cases.
    Auto-refresh old post lists (with preference)
    Display list of blocked subreddits on main menu
    #372 sort pinned subreddits (#376)
    
    * #372-sort pinned subbreddits based on name
    
    * addded setting for pinned subreddit sort strategy
    
    * added autoRefresh
    
    * fix typo
    
    * Set summary the RR way
    Add preference for configuring cache location (#370)
    
    This allows you to chose from the internal storage and all external storage locations.
    Changing the location will not migrate existing cache files, but they will still be
    loaded from the old location (and will exentually be pruned).
    
    This also removes the external storage permission for API 19 and above, since
    it's no longer required for the app-specific external storage directories.
    Ability to set default post sort
    Ability to change navbar colour
    Comment swiping
    Preference for comment long-click action, and made default comment tap action "collapse" rather than "menu"

    Added checkbox for disabling "replies to inbox" when replying to comments (#543)
    
    When replying to comments, it's now possible to disable that replies will be sent to the inbox. (Potential improvement: preference for default behaviour)
    
    Reddit's API endpoint /sendreplies is used for this.
    About the actual implementation, I'm not sure if it would be more elegant to move the actual call into CommentReplyActivity, but then we have to escalate the id of the newly created post, which would entail some refactoring.
    
    On another note, Reddit's API responses surely have to be a joke, right? No sane person could do that...

    * Added block, pin and subscribe actions to RedditPreparedPost's context menu
    
    Similiar to #458, I added menu items to (un)subscribe to a subreddit,
    (un)block and (un)pin it, depending on its current state.
    
    It's only activated when the subreddit's name is displayed.
    
    This should help satisfy #475.

    Added Context Menu for links
    
    Long-pressing on a link button now shows a context menu with following actions:
    * Copy URL to clipboard
    * Share URL
    * Open URL in external browser
    
    In case a link is an image, two additional actions are available:
    * Save Image
    * Share Image
    
    The actions are configurable through the menu preferences.
    
    I moved some image-and-permission-related code from RedditPreparedPost into own classes to make it better reusable.
    Added post fling action preference for "go back"
    Support for new post spoiler tag
    Issue #413 - share image directly (#418)
    
    * Issue #413 - share image directly
    
    * Share image intent title.
    
    * Only show "Share image" entry if post.mIsProbablyAnImage
    
    * Saving file to storage before creating Intent
    
    Even with intent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION),
    Whatsapp wouldn't accept the intent. Maybe they ignore mimetype
    and only look into file extension?
    
    This does the same as "Save image", but then shares said file.
    Multiple shares of the same file will repeatedly save the file.

    * lint: disable MissingTranslation
    
    * Replace space indents with tabs
    
    The project uses tabs, be consistent about it.
    
    * Take lint suggestion on apply() vs commit()
    
            Consider using apply() instead; commit writes its data to
            persistent storage immediately, whereas apply will handle it in
            the background

    * Make pruning age of entry marks (read, upvoted, etc.) configurable
    
    * Limit the total number of cached flag entries
    
    This is mainly a safeguard, to keep our memory usage constrained, even
    if the users sets the entry maxage to 3 months and looks at a LOT of
    posts/comments/etc. -- but we guesstimate that nobody will actually
    hit that 10k limit (if this should prove to be an issue, the limit
    could also be made configurable).

    Improved parsing of underscores (#468)
    
    * Improved parsing of underscores
    
    Should fix #465, but a few differences to Reddit's parser remain
    
    * Improved parsing of carets and parentheses
    
    Reddit markdown like `^(all of this is supposed to be in superscript)` is now being parsed correctly.
    
    There still are differences between this implementation and Reddit's with parentheses within superscript:
    In cases like
    `^(this is superscript and contains ( opening and closing ) parentheses)`, Reddit's parser ends the superscript with the first occurence of a closing parenthese and displays the second one. This implementation considers balanced parentheses more importantly and displays the first closing parentheses within the superscripted part and uses the second one to end that part.
    
    This behaviour can be changed easily, but it remains questionable to me if Reddit's behaviour should be mimicked
    
    * Removed unnecessary tests which were never meant to be committed
    
    (Failure originated from MockException)
    Extended long-press context menu to Imgur album viewer
    
    The aforementioned context menu for links now also works for single images in the imgur album viewer.
    Added Context Menu for links
    
    Long-pressing on a link button now shows a context menu with following actions:
    * Copy URL to clipboard
    * Share URL
    * Open URL in external browser
    
    In case a link is an image, two additional actions are available:
    * Save Image
    * Share Image
    
    The actions are configurable through the menu preferences.
    
    I moved some image-and-permission-related code from RedditPreparedPost into own classes to make it better reusable.

    Improved parsing of underscores (#468)
    
    * Improved parsing of underscores
    
    Should fix #465, but a few differences to Reddit's parser remain
    
    * Improved parsing of carets and parentheses
    
    Reddit markdown like `^(all of this is supposed to be in superscript)` is now being parsed correctly.
    
    There still are differences between this implementation and Reddit's with parentheses within superscript:
    In cases like
    `^(this is superscript and contains ( opening and closing ) parentheses)`, Reddit's parser ends the superscript with the first occurence of a closing parenthese and displays the second one. This implementation considers balanced parentheses more importantly and displays the first closing parentheses within the superscripted part and uses the second one to end that part.
    
    This behaviour can be changed easily, but it remains questionable to me if Reddit's behaviour should be mimicked
    
    * Removed unnecessary tests which were never meant to be committed
