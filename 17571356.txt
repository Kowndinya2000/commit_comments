    merged userbricks with current master
    cat-862 #fixed
    updated license and scope
    Merged catroidUiTest project into catroidTest
    add lint.xml files to Android project folders
    
    in order to be able to check lint warnings with our config,
    lint.xml files are introduced with ignored checks.
    - add lint.xml files (they were located in our jenkins repo)
    - remove them from .gitignore
    - move ignore logic in testprojects from Manifest to lint.xml
    - comment tools:ignore in .xml files
    - ignore NewApi warning for textAllCaps - is just capitalized
    on Android 2.3.x
    - ignore Icon Density warning - icons will be provided by UI team,
    and warning will be activated again
    Optimized Layouts & emptyView implementation
    
    * Removed unnecessary overdraw where possible
    * Added the correct handling of empty ListViews for Scripts, Looks,
      Sounds.
    * Fix tests that failed after removal of ListView
    * Deleted FtpProgressInputStream
    * Remove "fix" in UiTestUtils
    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.
    resolved conflict in brick_point_in_direction.xml

      system image, test it, then publish an update with this change."

    * Updated Manifest to use Theme.Catroid application-wide and not for
      every activity individually. Removes clutter.

    - long constants should be defined with upper L instead of l.
        l looks like the digit 1
    - add private constructor to utility classes!
        these classes contain only static methods/fields in their API,
        and it shouldn't be possible to instantiate them.
        private constructor is hiding implicit public default constructor!!!
    - classes with only private constructors should be declared final
    - each variable declaration should be in its own statement/own line
        according to several Code conventions/best practices

    Update Issue 211
    Added Japanese translation for category_lego_nxt.
    Renamed Consts to Constants and updated the references.
    
    As for the other languages which are missing some strings: We could kindly ask our GSoC students to translate some of them. But if the strings are not existent, the default - English - ones will be used. As our Russian/Romanian userbase is currently quite small, I suggest we neglect it for the moment, maybe even wait until we have a RC for v7 of Catroid, so we have a finalized version of strings.xml instead of adding, removing, correcting them every few commits.
    
    If you volunteer to translate the Japanese ones bit by bit, we can add Japanese to the unit tests, which look for untranslated strings (currently only active for German and English, as this is what 90%+ of our developers speak and can correct/add by themselves).

    Update Issue 211
    Added Japanese translation for category_lego_nxt.
    Renamed Consts to Constants and updated the references.
    
    As for the other languages which are missing some strings: We could kindly ask our GSoC students to translate some of them. But if the strings are not existent, the default - English - ones will be used. As our Russian/Romanian userbase is currently quite small, I suggest we neglect it for the moment, maybe even wait until we have a RC for v7 of Catroid, so we have a finalized version of strings.xml instead of adding, removing, correcting them every few commits.
    
    If you volunteer to translate the Japanese ones bit by bit, we can add Japanese to the unit tests, which look for untranslated strings (currently only active for German and English, as this is what 90%+ of our developers speak and can correct/add by themselves).

    Fixed crash when no SD Card is present
    
    * Check for SD Card improved. We now not only look for mounted media but
      also make sure it's not READ_ONLY. The new function name reflects
      that.
    * Added the check in MainMenuActivities onCreate() so we display an
      error message and quit gracefully instead of crashing.
    
    I tried to write a test for this using PowerMock + Mockito but did not
    succeed. In fact, I did not get to the point where I could even compile
    with these libraries added. Android Support was added to Mockito in
    1.9.5 but it seems there is no ready-to-use PowerMock package for
    Android. I encountered various errors while trying to make a runnable
    package.
    The other approach would be to rewrite the functions with e.g.
    Dependency Injection so we can insert e.g. a MockEnviroment to the Utils
    function or similar approaches.
    In the end, I decided to not do test-first in this case so this critical
    issue can get closed and find a way to test it later on.
    removed unused statement
    testBuildProjectPath: Use Constants.DEFAULT_ROOT instead of hardcoded
    path.
    Slightly adapted testBuildProjectPath:

    If you volunteer to translate the Japanese ones bit by bit, we can add Japanese to the unit tests, which look for untranslated strings (currently only active for German and English, as this is what 90%+ of our developers speak and can correct/add by themselves).

    Fixed Issue 116
    Changed volumes from double to float, because in the end we need float, because that's what the Android API wants. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaPlayer.html#setVolume(float, float)
    
    Also, I was unable to think of a test for this, because while we can _set_ the volume of individual MediaPlayers, there is currently no way of getting it, besides remembering it.
    
    Update issue 116
    Owner: aried3r@gmail.com
    I fixed this issue, note however that the volume is a global one amongst all media players. When setting the volume to 100%, _all_ sounds in _all_ sprites will have 100%.

    ad B6.10 - SoundManagerTest fails sometimes: Commented out testPauseAndResumeMultiplePlayers() because it was useless (un-comment and run it to see). Test was left in there because there seems to be more of a problem with the SoundManager (paused MediaPlayers are recycled, even if they might be used). See ticket "Improve MediaPlayer recycling" for details.
    B6.10 - SoundManagerTest fails sometimes: Fixed & accepted
    Note: Removed tests and asserts. Changes have been approved by Wolfgang.
    Summary:
    - Waiting for MediaPlayers to finish has been removed from all tests. It was considered useless as it test Android-internal functionality & behavior that is outside our control.
    - testPlayMultipleSounds removed. Same reasons as above + potentially different behavior with different hardware
    - testGetMultipleMediaPlayers was useless because the SoundManager fetched the same MediaPlayer all the time. A more meaningful test has been added to testPauseAndResumeMultiplePlayers

    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.

    Renamed Consts to Constants and updated the references.
    
    As for the other languages which are missing some strings: We could kindly ask our GSoC students to translate some of them. But if the strings are not existent, the default - English - ones will be used. As our Russian/Romanian userbase is currently quite small, I suggest we neglect it for the moment, maybe even wait until we have a RC for v7 of Catroid, so we have a finalized version of strings.xml instead of adding, removing, correcting them every few commits.
    
    If you volunteer to translate the Japanese ones bit by bit, we can add Japanese to the unit tests, which look for untranslated strings (currently only active for German and English, as this is what 90%+ of our developers speak and can correct/add by themselves).

    Don't panic, most changes are just because I added missing license texts.

    As for the other languages which are missing some strings: We could kindly ask our GSoC students to translate some of them. But if the strings are not existent, the default - English - ones will be used. As our Russian/Romanian userbase is currently quite small, I suggest we neglect it for the moment, maybe even wait until we have a RC for v7 of Catroid, so we have a finalized version of strings.xml instead of adding, removing, correcting them every few commits.
    
    If you volunteer to translate the Japanese ones bit by bit, we can add Japanese to the unit tests, which look for untranslated strings (currently only active for German and English, as this is what 90%+ of our developers speak and can correct/add by themselves).

    As for the other languages which are missing some strings: We could kindly ask our GSoC students to translate some of them. But if the strings are not existent, the default - English - ones will be used. As our Russian/Romanian userbase is currently quite small, I suggest we neglect it for the moment, maybe even wait until we have a RC for v7 of Catroid, so we have a finalized version of strings.xml instead of adding, removing, correcting them every few commits.
    
    If you volunteer to translate the Japanese ones bit by bit, we can add Japanese to the unit tests, which look for untranslated strings (currently only active for German and English, as this is what 90%+ of our developers speak and can correct/add by themselves).

    B6.10 - SoundManagerTest fails sometimes: Fixed & accepted
    Note: Removed tests and asserts. Changes have been approved by Wolfgang.
    Summary:
    - Waiting for MediaPlayers to finish has been removed from all tests. It was considered useless as it test Android-internal functionality & behavior that is outside our control.
    - testPlayMultipleSounds removed. Same reasons as above + potentially different behavior with different hardware
    - testGetMultipleMediaPlayers was useless because the SoundManager fetched the same MediaPlayer all the time. A more meaningful test has been added to testPauseAndResumeMultiplePlayers

    As for the other languages which are missing some strings: We could kindly ask our GSoC students to translate some of them. But if the strings are not existent, the default - English - ones will be used. As our Russian/Romanian userbase is currently quite small, I suggest we neglect it for the moment, maybe even wait until we have a RC for v7 of Catroid, so we have a finalized version of strings.xml instead of adding, removing, correcting them every few commits.
    
    If you volunteer to translate the Japanese ones bit by bit, we can add Japanese to the unit tests, which look for untranslated strings (currently only active for German and English, as this is what 90%+ of our developers speak and can correct/add by themselves).

    Fixed Issue 116
    Changed volumes from double to float, because in the end we need float, because that's what the Android API wants. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaPlayer.html#setVolume(float, float)
    
    Also, I was unable to think of a test for this, because while we can _set_ the volume of individual MediaPlayers, there is currently no way of getting it, besides remembering it.
    
    Update issue 116
    Owner: aried3r@gmail.com
    I fixed this issue, note however that the volume is a global one amongst all media players. When setting the volume to 100%, _all_ sounds in _all_ sprites will have 100%.

    As for the other languages which are missing some strings: We could kindly ask our GSoC students to translate some of them. But if the strings are not existent, the default - English - ones will be used. As our Russian/Romanian userbase is currently quite small, I suggest we neglect it for the moment, maybe even wait until we have a RC for v7 of Catroid, so we have a finalized version of strings.xml instead of adding, removing, correcting them every few commits.
    
    If you volunteer to translate the Japanese ones bit by bit, we can add Japanese to the unit tests, which look for untranslated strings (currently only active for German and English, as this is what 90%+ of our developers speak and can correct/add by themselves).

    Update Issue 211
    Added Japanese translation for category_lego_nxt.
    Renamed Consts to Constants and updated the references.
    
    As for the other languages which are missing some strings: We could kindly ask our GSoC students to translate some of them. But if the strings are not existent, the default - English - ones will be used. As our Russian/Romanian userbase is currently quite small, I suggest we neglect it for the moment, maybe even wait until we have a RC for v7 of Catroid, so we have a finalized version of strings.xml instead of adding, removing, correcting them every few commits.
    
    If you volunteer to translate the Japanese ones bit by bit, we can add Japanese to the unit tests, which look for untranslated strings (currently only active for German and English, as this is what 90%+ of our developers speak and can correct/add by themselves).

    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.

    Update Issue 211
    Added Japanese translation for category_lego_nxt.
    Renamed Consts to Constants and updated the references.
    
    As for the other languages which are missing some strings: We could kindly ask our GSoC students to translate some of them. But if the strings are not existent, the default - English - ones will be used. As our Russian/Romanian userbase is currently quite small, I suggest we neglect it for the moment, maybe even wait until we have a RC for v7 of Catroid, so we have a finalized version of strings.xml instead of adding, removing, correcting them every few commits.
    
    If you volunteer to translate the Japanese ones bit by bit, we can add Japanese to the unit tests, which look for untranslated strings (currently only active for German and English, as this is what 90%+ of our developers speak and can correct/add by themselves).
    7.32C: fix for nullpointer

    Fix testReturnFromStageAfterInvokingFormulaEditor
    
    Run testcase testReturnFromStageAfterInvokingFormulaEditor only when 'Don't keep activities' is set.
    Fix issue #660
    
    Activate "Don't keep activities" in Developer options to reproduce this bug. When invoking the FormulaEditorFragment from the ScriptFragment it becomes registered with the ScriptActivity as the ScriptActivity is a FragmentActivity. Hence, when leaving the ScriptActivity by entering the stage and returning again by leaving the stage, it will try to resume its fragments. During this process it tries to access formulaTextFieldId of Formula.java. However this field is not available (= null) because it is declared transient. When not declaring the formulaTextFieldId as transient the NullPointerException will be avoided though the FormulaEditorFragment will be loaded anyway. Because all of this only happens when leaving the ScriptActivity via the PlayButton the FormulaEditorFragment is removed beforehand. So if now returning from stage the FormulaEditorFragment is not registered with the ScriptActivity and will not be started by the ScriptActivity.
    Fix for the NullpointerException upon copying a copied brick

    The Bottombar separator is now handled automatically by BottomBar.java

    trying to fix failing test on jenkinsserver
    ScriptFragmentTest stabilzed.
    
    solo.searchText() was failing 1 out of 10 times ('verified' by running
    the particular test repeatedly on the test server), so I changed it to
    solo.waitForText() with a small timeout instead of a solo.sleep().
    
    Note: waitForText() itself sleeps for 500ms inbetween checks.

    Refactored test in an attempt to escape OOM Error
    
    While unable to find our memory leak on orientation change so far, I
    adopted some tests that were especially prone to leak memory, leading to
    OOM errors. Of course this is not a real solution but a workaround. I'll
    keep on digging in the Heap and Allocation analysis tools to find it.
    
    Even if we, in the upcoming release, lock Catroid to portrait mode, it
    would be better to detect the leak anyway.
    Refactored method calls, moved method in MainMenu
    
    Refactored getActivity().getString() to solo.getString(), supposedly,
    this is the correct way to do it with Robotium.

    Bottom bar hidden on action mode
    
    Fixes #641
    The BottomBar is now hidden everywhere where it is not intended to be,
    like renaming/deleting objects (instead of disabling the buttons in the
    Bottombar).
    Also the BottomBar.java class has changed. Now there are methods for
    showing and hiding the BottomBar and the Add+Play - Button.
    The Bottombar separator is now handled automatically by BottomBar.java
    (was: setting separator visibility manually where it was needed).

    Update Issue 211
    Added Japanese translation for category_lego_nxt.
    Renamed Consts to Constants and updated the references.
    
    As for the other languages which are missing some strings: We could kindly ask our GSoC students to translate some of them. But if the strings are not existent, the default - English - ones will be used. As our Russian/Romanian userbase is currently quite small, I suggest we neglect it for the moment, maybe even wait until we have a RC for v7 of Catroid, so we have a finalized version of strings.xml instead of adding, removing, correcting them every few commits.
    
    If you volunteer to translate the Japanese ones bit by bit, we can add Japanese to the unit tests, which look for untranslated strings (currently only active for German and English, as this is what 90%+ of our developers speak and can correct/add by themselves).

    New workflow when creating a new object
    
    This will change the workflow when a new object is added. From now on
    there should be always a look be added too. Therefore the UX/UI Team
    decided to implement this two step dialog:
     1. Choose a new look from Paintroid (if installed), Gallery or Camera
     2. A preview of the selected look will be given and the user can enter
    the object's name
     3. If everything goes well the new object will be created and the app
    will jump into the new object's script activity
    
    Additionally if the user adds the new object within the script activity
    (PointToBrick) the user will be asked to jump to the new object.
    Remove duplicate code, cleanup when possible
    
    * Settings menu moved to BaseActivity

    Bottom bar hidden on action mode
    
    Fixes #641
    The BottomBar is now hidden everywhere where it is not intended to be,
    like renaming/deleting objects (instead of disabling the buttons in the
    Bottombar).
    Also the BottomBar.java class has changed. Now there are methods for
    showing and hiding the BottomBar and the Add+Play - Button.
    The Bottombar separator is now handled automatically by BottomBar.java
    (was: setting separator visibility manually where it was needed).

    Display if a variable is local or global
    
    The Variable list now has 2 headers to distinguish between local and global variables.
    
    - added fragment_formula_editor_variablelist_global_headline.xml and fragment_formula_editor_variablelist_local_headline.xml. These .xml files are included in fragment_formula_editor_variablelist_item.xml and used to display the headlines.
    
    - added strings for headlines in strings.xml files in /values and /values-de
    
    - added styles for headlines in style.xml
    
    - changed the getView method of the UserVariableAdapter, so that headlines are displayed at the correct position

    change SoundActivityTest to ScriptActivityTest
    The test was originally designed to test the SoundActivity, but should

    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.
    add eclipse pref for import order

    Fix #496, Rate app link in overflow menu
    
    The test is very minimalistic for a few reasons. On the emulator, there
    is no Play Store App, on a device there probably is, but clicking the
    menu would then leave Catroid. This would cause us to lose control over
    the test, because we're not in Catroid anymore.

    Refactored AboutDialog a little bit.
    
    * Renamed resources where necessary
    * Deleted test in MainMenuActivityTest because the same is already being
      tested in AboutDialogTest
    Deleted tests that have been unused out for a year
    
    git blame showed that these were commented out for over a year. During
    the acceptance of the redesign of the MainMenuActivity, we decided to
    delete them.
    Refactored method calls, moved method in MainMenu
    
    Refactored getActivity().getString() to solo.getString(), supposedly,
    this is the correct way to do it with Robotium.
    
    Moved actionBar.setTitle() from onResume() to onCreate().
    Fixed tests that I accidently broke
    Tests fixed and removed after 'Start' was removed.
    
    * Tests that unnecessarily tested orientation change (in MainMenuActivity)
    removed if they don't test anything else or adopted if they test
    something else too.
    * Some tests looked at the Actionbar title to check if a project was
    loaded. With the removal of the project title form the actionbar
    (app_name is now shown in Main Menu) a different approach was necessary.
    Added test to assert that Main Menu is in portrait
    
    Since Robotium can force the activity to be in landscape mode, no matter
    the settings in the manifest (they can later be overridden), this test
    first asserts that we're indeed in portrait mode and secondly tests if
    the setting in AndroidManifest.xml was set to portrait.
    Prevent screen orientation change in Main Menu.
    
    Forced MainMenuActivity to be in portrait mode only by modifying the
    AndroidMainifest.xml (android:screenOrientation="portrait"). Then went
    on to remove all tests that tried an orientation change.
    Adopted more tests to the new layout
    Removed last traces of old MainMenu strings.
    
    Commented out the old MainMenuActivity strings in all remaining
    languages to find all old occurances and adapted those.
    Moved About and Settings to overflow menu

    7.32C: small adjustments in package uitest.ui
    7.32C: revert last changes
    Update Issue 211
    Added Japanese translation for category_lego_nxt.
    Renamed Consts to Constants and updated the references.
    
    As for the other languages which are missing some strings: We could kindly ask our GSoC students to translate some of them. But if the strings are not existent, the default - English - ones will be used. As our Russian/Romanian userbase is currently quite small, I suggest we neglect it for the moment, maybe even wait until we have a RC for v7 of Catroid, so we have a finalized version of strings.xml instead of adding, removing, correcting them every few commits.
    
    If you volunteer to translate the Japanese ones bit by bit, we can add Japanese to the unit tests, which look for untranslated strings (currently only active for German and English, as this is what 90%+ of our developers speak and can correct/add by themselves).

    New workflow when creating a new object
    
    This will change the workflow when a new object is added. From now on
    there should be always a look be added too. Therefore the UX/UI Team
    decided to implement this two step dialog:
     1. Choose a new look from Paintroid (if installed), Gallery or Camera
     2. A preview of the selected look will be given and the user can enter
    the object's name
     3. If everything goes well the new object will be created and the app
    will jump into the new object's script activity
    
    Additionally if the user adds the new object within the script activity
    (PointToBrick) the user will be asked to jump to the new object.

    Bottom bar hidden on action mode
    
    Fixes #641
    The BottomBar is now hidden everywhere where it is not intended to be,
    like renaming/deleting objects (instead of disabling the buttons in the
    Bottombar).
    Also the BottomBar.java class has changed. Now there are methods for
    showing and hiding the BottomBar and the Add+Play - Button.
    The Bottombar separator is now handled automatically by BottomBar.java
    (was: setting separator visibility manually where it was needed).

    resolved conflict in brick_point_in_direction.xml
    fix for orientation tests
    
    these tests would have failed, if the activity before allowed

    attempt to get rid of the OOM Error.
    Refactored method calls, moved method in MainMenu
    
    Refactored getActivity().getString() to solo.getString(), supposedly,
    this is the correct way to do it with Robotium.
    
    Moved actionBar.setTitle() from onResume() to onCreate().
    Tests fixed and removed after 'Start' was removed.
    
    * Tests that unnecessarily tested orientation change (in MainMenuActivity)
    removed if they don't test anything else or adopted if they test
    something else too.
    * Some tests looked at the Actionbar title to check if a project was
    loaded. With the removal of the project title form the actionbar
    (app_name is now shown in Main Menu) a different approach was necessary.
    Removed last traces of old MainMenu strings.
    
    Commented out the old MainMenuActivity strings in all remaining
    languages to find all old occurances and adapted those.

    New workflow when creating a new object
    
    This will change the workflow when a new object is added. From now on
    there should be always a look be added too. Therefore the UX/UI Team
    decided to implement this two step dialog:
     1. Choose a new look from Paintroid (if installed), Gallery or Camera
     2. A preview of the selected look will be given and the user can enter
    the object's name
     3. If everything goes well the new object will be created and the app
    will jump into the new object's script activity
    
    Additionally if the user adds the new object within the script activity
    (PointToBrick) the user will be asked to jump to the new object.
    Hide and show the SelectAll button appropriately
    Delete duplicate rename function in ProjectManager

    Bottom bar hidden on action mode
    
    Fixes #641
    The BottomBar is now hidden everywhere where it is not intended to be,
    like renaming/deleting objects (instead of disabling the buttons in the
    Bottombar).
    Also the BottomBar.java class has changed. Now there are methods for
    showing and hiding the BottomBar and the Add+Play - Button.
    The Bottombar separator is now handled automatically by BottomBar.java
    (was: setting separator visibility manually where it was needed).
    
    Jenkins Testrun(s):
    https://jenkins.catrob.at/job/Catroid-Multi-Job-Custom-Branch/355/

     * quick fix which bans copy icon from action bar
    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.

    Important Change: Had to take the screenshot at the second frame instead
    of the first in the render() method of the StageListener, because the
    ScreenUtils.getFrameBufferPixels() method used to get the pixels,
    returns an all white picture in ~1/5 trys and this was untestable.(And
    not intended behaviour)

    screenshot not being saved or the thumbnail not loading correctly.

    Update Issue 211
    Added Japanese translation for category_lego_nxt.
    Renamed Consts to Constants and updated the references.
    
    As for the other languages which are missing some strings: We could kindly ask our GSoC students to translate some of them. But if the strings are not existent, the default - English - ones will be used. As our Russian/Romanian userbase is currently quite small, I suggest we neglect it for the moment, maybe even wait until we have a RC for v7 of Catroid, so we have a finalized version of strings.xml instead of adding, removing, correcting them every few commits.
    
    If you volunteer to translate the Japanese ones bit by bit, we can add Japanese to the unit tests, which look for untranslated strings (currently only active for German and English, as this is what 90%+ of our developers speak and can correct/add by themselves).

    New workflow when creating a new object
    
    This will change the workflow when a new object is added. From now on
    there should be always a look be added too. Therefore the UX/UI Team
    decided to implement this two step dialog:
     1. Choose a new look from Paintroid (if installed), Gallery or Camera
     2. A preview of the selected look will be given and the user can enter
    the object's name
     3. If everything goes well the new object will be created and the app
    will jump into the new object's script activity
    
    Additionally if the user adds the new object within the script activity
    (PointToBrick) the user will be asked to jump to the new object.

    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.

    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.

    - no context available; currently hardcoded program names
      needed for cleaning up pocket code directory
    - BroadcastBricksTest caused IndexOutOfBoundsExceptions -
      starting from MainMenuActivity should work
    - modified SettingsActivityTest; testOrientation tested
      MainMenuActivty instead of SettingsActivity
    - WebView methods have to be run on the UI Thread -
      at least our new emulator (api18) complained
    - move randomly failing testcases to Devicetest
    - delete SharedPreferences projectname - could cause
      Nullpointers on later tests

    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.

    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.

    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.

    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.

    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.

    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.

    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.
    add eclipse pref for import order

    Update Issue 211
    Added Japanese translation for category_lego_nxt.
    Renamed Consts to Constants and updated the references.
    
    As for the other languages which are missing some strings: We could kindly ask our GSoC students to translate some of them. But if the strings are not existent, the default - English - ones will be used. As our Russian/Romanian userbase is currently quite small, I suggest we neglect it for the moment, maybe even wait until we have a RC for v7 of Catroid, so we have a finalized version of strings.xml instead of adding, removing, correcting them every few commits.
    
    If you volunteer to translate the Japanese ones bit by bit, we can add Japanese to the unit tests, which look for untranslated strings (currently only active for German and English, as this is what 90%+ of our developers speak and can correct/add by themselves).

    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.

    New workflow when creating a new object
    
    This will change the workflow when a new object is added. From now on
    there should be always a look be added too. Therefore the UX/UI Team
    decided to implement this two step dialog:
     1. Choose a new look from Paintroid (if installed), Gallery or Camera
     2. A preview of the selected look will be given and the user can enter
    the object's name
     3. If everything goes well the new object will be created and the app
    will jump into the new object's script activity
    
    Additionally if the user adds the new object within the script activity
    (PointToBrick) the user will be asked to jump to the new object.

    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.

    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.

    Update Issue 211
    Added Japanese translation for category_lego_nxt.
    Renamed Consts to Constants and updated the references.
    
    As for the other languages which are missing some strings: We could kindly ask our GSoC students to translate some of them. But if the strings are not existent, the default - English - ones will be used. As our Russian/Romanian userbase is currently quite small, I suggest we neglect it for the moment, maybe even wait until we have a RC for v7 of Catroid, so we have a finalized version of strings.xml instead of adding, removing, correcting them every few commits.
    
    If you volunteer to translate the Japanese ones bit by bit, we can add Japanese to the unit tests, which look for untranslated strings (currently only active for German and English, as this is what 90%+ of our developers speak and can correct/add by themselves).

    * Tests that unnecessarily tested orientation change (in MainMenuActivity)
    removed if they don't test anything else or adopted if they test
    something else too.
    * Some tests looked at the Actionbar title to check if a project was
    loaded. With the removal of the project title form the actionbar
    (app_name is now shown in Main Menu) a different approach was necessary.
    Removed last traces of old MainMenu strings.
    
    Commented out the old MainMenuActivity strings in all remaining
    languages to find all old occurances and adapted those.

    7.32C: refactoring should be done
    Update Issue 211
    Added Japanese translation for category_lego_nxt.
    Renamed Consts to Constants and updated the references.
    
    As for the other languages which are missing some strings: We could kindly ask our GSoC students to translate some of them. But if the strings are not existent, the default - English - ones will be used. As our Russian/Romanian userbase is currently quite small, I suggest we neglect it for the moment, maybe even wait until we have a RC for v7 of Catroid, so we have a finalized version of strings.xml instead of adding, removing, correcting them every few commits.
    
    If you volunteer to translate the Japanese ones bit by bit, we can add Japanese to the unit tests, which look for untranslated strings (currently only active for German and English, as this is what 90%+ of our developers speak and can correct/add by themselves).

    New workflow when creating a new object
    
    This will change the workflow when a new object is added. From now on
    there should be always a look be added too. Therefore the UX/UI Team
    decided to implement this two step dialog:
     1. Choose a new look from Paintroid (if installed), Gallery or Camera
     2. A preview of the selected look will be given and the user can enter
    the object's name
     3. If everything goes well the new object will be created and the app
    will jump into the new object's script activity
    
    Additionally if the user adds the new object within the script activity
    (PointToBrick) the user will be asked to jump to the new object.

    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.

    Update Issue 211
    Added Japanese translation for category_lego_nxt.
    Renamed Consts to Constants and updated the references.
    
    As for the other languages which are missing some strings: We could kindly ask our GSoC students to translate some of them. But if the strings are not existent, the default - English - ones will be used. As our Russian/Romanian userbase is currently quite small, I suggest we neglect it for the moment, maybe even wait until we have a RC for v7 of Catroid, so we have a finalized version of strings.xml instead of adding, removing, correcting them every few commits.
    
    If you volunteer to translate the Japanese ones bit by bit, we can add Japanese to the unit tests, which look for untranslated strings (currently only active for German and English, as this is what 90%+ of our developers speak and can correct/add by themselves).

    * Checkstyle is now part of the `build` lifecycle
    * `gradle.properties` file added, includes the daemon and parallel
      execution. AFAIK this is not honoured by AS as it has its own settings
      and uses the daemon by default, but it speeds up commandline builds
      (not clean builds but incremental ones). Benchmarks below.
    * Had to change the classpath variable of the checkstyle task because
      otherwise it wouldn't compile for me. Works on my machine doing `gw
      checkstyle`.

    Results:
    `gw clean build` is a bit faster, but not by a lot, `clean` is a
    lot faster, as are subsequent incremental builds (note: not really an
    incremental build in this case, because the source wasn't modified at
    all). I use these settings at work on the console and did not encounter
    any problems so far. For parallel builds in Android Studio, see the
    compiler settings there.

    Refactored StringsTest to be more accurate
    
    Previously, StringsTest.java, when looking for a string like
    'R.string.no', would also match 'R.string.notification'. Thus, falsly
    thnking that 'R.string.no' was indeed a used string, when there was no
    occurance of it.
    I corrected it via a Regex pattern in the hopes to get more accurate
    results in the future. A few strings were removed after the test found
    a few of these cases.
    
    values/strings.xml was modified as a whole, changing line endings from
    \r\n to \n.
    
    I added <!-- --> after string categories because it makes a much nicer
    formatting, categories are now visibly separated from each other.

    (from 124 to 86)
    enable more checkstyle rules and refactor code
    
    - remove nested blocks
    - change C style arrays to java style
    - long constants should be defined with upper L instead of l.
        l looks like the digit 1
    - add private constructor to utility classes!
        these classes contain only static methods/fields in their API,
        and it shouldn't be possible to instantiate them.
        private constructor is hiding implicit public default constructor!!!
    - classes with only private constructors should be declared final
    - each variable declaration should be in its own statement/own line
        according to several Code conventions/best practices
    - refactored Singletons
    add eclipse pref for import order
    
    - should be the same as in Android Studio
    - rename packages to lowercase
    resolved conflict in brick_point_in_direction.xml
    update of licensetexts

      Also I want to force people to update their SDK.
    * Updated Manifest to use Theme.Catroid application-wide and not for
      every activity individually. Removes clutter.
    * Updated project.properties to use target=android-18. This does not
      affect the final APK, it's just what Eclipse offers us as APIs.

    'Refactor' Manifest. (Themes, targetSdk)
    
    * Updated Manifest to use targetSdkVersion=18
      Quote:
      "To better optimize your app for devices running Android 4.3, you
      should set your targetSdkVersion to "18", install it on an Android 4.3
      system image, test it, then publish an update with this change."
      https://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-4.3.html
      Also I want to force people to update their SDK.
    * Updated Manifest to use Theme.Catroid application-wide and not for
      every activity individually. Removes clutter.
    * Updated project.properties to use target=android-18. This does not
      affect the final APK, it's just what Eclipse offers us as APIs.

    2010-2012 -> 2010-2013
    adapter interface for ScriptActivity adapters
    Upped targedSdk, removed debuggable, req. OpenGL20
    
    * Increased the android:targetSdkVersion from 15 (IceCreamSandwich) to
      17 (Jelly Bean) so that no compatibility modes are used. Since we have
      a lot of 4.2.1 devices in our project our app implicitly gets tested
      on this API level.
    * Removed android:debuggable="true".
      Reason: Since SDK Tools, Revision 8 (from December 2010!) this is no
      longer needed.
      Quote from  https://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/tools-notes.html
      "Support for a true debug build. Developers no longer need to add the
      android:debuggable attribute to the <application> tag in the manifest
      — the build tools add the attribute automatically. In Eclipse/ADT, all
      incremental builds are assumed to be debug builds, so the tools insert
      android:debuggable="true". When exporting a signed release build, the
      tools do not add the attribute. In Ant, a ant debug command
      automatically inserts the android:debuggable="true" attribute, while
      ant release does not. If android:debuggable="true" is manually set,
      then ant release will actually do a debug build, rather than a release
      build."
    * Require OpenGL 2.0 ES.
      Catroid now requires OpenGL ES 2.0. Please see http://goo.gl/GzZ7X for
      details. The main reason for us to do this is that Google Play filters
      apps based on - among other criteria - the <uses-feature> elements.
      Since we use libgdx in OpenGL ES 2.0 mode, users without it cannot
      properly use Catroid and the Stage would force close. By adding this
      element, Catroid will not be shown in the Play Store for them, thus
      avoiding this issue.
      Please also see
      https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html#OpenGL for
      more information about the relative number of devices that support
      Open GL ES 2.0 (at the time of writing, almost 91%).

    New workflow when creating a new object
    
    This will change the workflow when a new object is added. From now on
    there should be always a look be added too. Therefore the UX/UI Team
    decided to implement this two step dialog:
     1. Choose a new look from Paintroid (if installed), Gallery or Camera
     2. A preview of the selected look will be given and the user can enter
    the object's name
     3. If everything goes well the new object will be created and the app
    will jump into the new object's script activity
    
    Additionally if the user adds the new object within the script activity
    (PointToBrick) the user will be asked to jump to the new object.

    New workflow when creating a new object
    
    This will change the workflow when a new object is added. From now on
    there should be always a look be added too. Therefore the UX/UI Team
    decided to implement this two step dialog:
     1. Choose a new look from Paintroid (if installed), Gallery or Camera
     2. A preview of the selected look will be given and the user can enter
    the object's name
     3. If everything goes well the new object will be created and the app
    will jump into the new object's script activity
    
    Additionally if the user adds the new object within the script activity
    (PointToBrick) the user will be asked to jump to the new object.

    This change is not needed for API v14 or above (not tested on Honeycomb).

    License text updated
    changing license texts in tests
    Closing Branch, again?
    5.51c: Added test for license text in every file (.java + .xml). Taken from the paintroid project and improved ;)
    Don't panic, most changes are just because I added missing license texts.
    Done & Accepted
    5.5, 5.9, 5.10: Implementation + tests of Sprite, ShowBrick and HideBrick
    changed name of package and project!
    added new Scratch2Android, test project and .hgignore

    updated license and scope
    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.

    repository now. This will have to be done in another branch ;-)
    Terms of Use menu and dialog added.
    Terms of Use: UI test (should fail!)
    
    UI test should fail since we use Test First, i.e., this is only the
    test; the corresponding main code is not yet implemented!
    convert old language version to current on load
    New workflow when creating a new object
    
    This will change the workflow when a new object is added. From now on
    there should be always a look be added too. Therefore the UX/UI Team
    decided to implement this two step dialog:
     1. Choose a new look from Paintroid (if installed), Gallery or Camera
     2. A preview of the selected look will be given and the user can enter
    the object's name
     3. If everything goes well the new object will be created and the app
    will jump into the new object's script activity
    
    Additionally if the user adds the new object within the script activity
    (PointToBrick) the user will be asked to jump to the new object.

    Fix #496, Rate app link in overflow menu
    
    The test is very minimalistic for a few reasons. On the emulator, there
    is no Play Store App, on a device there probably is, but clicking the
    menu would then leave Catroid. This would cause us to lose control over
    the test, because we're not in Catroid anymore.

    Refactored StringsTest to be more accurate
    
    Previously, StringsTest.java, when looking for a string like
    'R.string.no', would also match 'R.string.notification'. Thus, falsly
    thnking that 'R.string.no' was indeed a used string, when there was no
    occurance of it.
    I corrected it via a Regex pattern in the hopes to get more accurate
    results in the future. A few strings were removed after the test found
    a few of these cases.
    
    values/strings.xml was modified as a whole, changing line endings from
    \r\n to \n.
    
    I added <!-- --> after string categories because it makes a much nicer
    formatting, categories are now visibly separated from each other.
    Added new strings, deleted old ones.

    MainMenuActivty, but weren't from what I can see. Then added the new

    found in /res/drawable. They are all the same but already have the
    correct names, so once the icons arrive, they can be just dropped in.

    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.

    New workflow when creating a new object
    
    This will change the workflow when a new object is added. From now on
    there should be always a look be added too. Therefore the UX/UI Team
    decided to implement this two step dialog:
     1. Choose a new look from Paintroid (if installed), Gallery or Camera
     2. A preview of the selected look will be given and the user can enter
    the object's name
     3. If everything goes well the new object will be created and the app
    will jump into the new object's script activity
    
    Additionally if the user adds the new object within the script activity
    (PointToBrick) the user will be asked to jump to the new object.

    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.

    New workflow when creating a new object
    
    This will change the workflow when a new object is added. From now on
    there should be always a look be added too. Therefore the UX/UI Team
    decided to implement this two step dialog:
     1. Choose a new look from Paintroid (if installed), Gallery or Camera
     2. A preview of the selected look will be given and the user can enter
    the object's name
     3. If everything goes well the new object will be created and the app
    will jump into the new object's script activity
    
    Additionally if the user adds the new object within the script activity
    (PointToBrick) the user will be asked to jump to the new object.

    New workflow when creating a new object
    
    This will change the workflow when a new object is added. From now on
    there should be always a look be added too. Therefore the UX/UI Team
    decided to implement this two step dialog:
     1. Choose a new look from Paintroid (if installed), Gallery or Camera
     2. A preview of the selected look will be given and the user can enter
    the object's name
     3. If everything goes well the new object will be created and the app
    will jump into the new object's script activity
    
    Additionally if the user adds the new object within the script activity
    (PointToBrick) the user will be asked to jump to the new object.
    add lint.xml files to Android project folders
    
    in order to be able to check lint warnings with our config,
    lint.xml files are introduced with ignored checks.
    - add lint.xml files (they were located in our jenkins repo)
    - remove them from .gitignore
    - move ignore logic in testprojects from Manifest to lint.xml
    - comment tools:ignore in .xml files
    - ignore NewApi warning for textAllCaps - is just capitalized
    on Android 2.3.x
    - ignore Icon Density warning - icons will be provided by UI team,
    and warning will be activated again
    Optimized Layouts & emptyView implementation
    
    * Removed unnecessary overdraw where possible
    * Added the correct handling of empty ListViews for Scripts, Looks,
      Sounds.
    * Fix tests that failed after removal of ListView
    * Deleted FtpProgressInputStream
    * Remove "fix" in UiTestUtils
    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.

    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.
    aligned text left

    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.

    updated license and scope
    Fixes #676
    
    Added 1 Suppression and 2 ignore statements as FormulaEditor and the Fragments need a big refactoring
    concerning these lint issues.
    Optimized Layouts & emptyView implementation
    
    * Removed unnecessary overdraw where possible
    * Added the correct handling of empty ListViews for Scripts, Looks,
      Sounds.
    * Fix tests that failed after removal of ListView
    * Deleted FtpProgressInputStream

    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.
    remove divider
    remove unnecessary XML tags
    AddBrickFragment added and actionbar implemented
    Change BrickCategoryDialog to BrickCategoryFragment
    redesigned ProjectActivity
    * added necessary pngs
    * redesigned bottom bar
    .gitattributes file added to normalize line ending
    
    In today's meeting it was decided that we normalize the line endings
    over the course of time instead of normalizing the whole repo at once.
    
    This *will* break git blame.

    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.

    New workflow when creating a new object
    
    This will change the workflow when a new object is added. From now on
    there should be always a look be added too. Therefore the UX/UI Team
    decided to implement this two step dialog:
     1. Choose a new look from Paintroid (if installed), Gallery or Camera
     2. A preview of the selected look will be given and the user can enter
    the object's name
     3. If everything goes well the new object will be created and the app
    will jump into the new object's script activity
    
    Additionally if the user adds the new object within the script activity
    (PointToBrick) the user will be asked to jump to the new object.

    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.
    greyed all bricks - finally
    removed double ns' in brick xml's
    added layout id to bricks
    implemented alpha value for all bricks
    stopped listeners of all bricks when necessary

    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.
    changed degrees text to symbol in turn left and turn right brick

    problem and can be adapted, and works for at least english/ german in
    the upcoming release.
    
    Also added the distinction to the getPrototypeView() functions to
    prevent the template bricks displaying a different plurality than they
    get by default when inserted.
    refactored xmls to be clickable on prototype
    
    + id's for checkboxes

    New workflow when creating a new object
    
    This will change the workflow when a new object is added. From now on
    there should be always a look be added too. Therefore the UX/UI Team
    decided to implement this two step dialog:
     1. Choose a new look from Paintroid (if installed), Gallery or Camera
     2. A preview of the selected look will be given and the user can enter
    the object's name
     3. If everything goes well the new object will be created and the app
    will jump into the new object's script activity
    
    Additionally if the user adds the new object within the script activity
    (PointToBrick) the user will be asked to jump to the new object.

    merged userbricks with current master
    cat-862 #fixed
    updated license and scope
    Changed namespace for BrickLayout view to res-auto
    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.
    changed degrees text to symbol in turn left and turn right brick
    fixed all false and missing id calls
    changed brick styles accordingly
    added layout id to bricks
    implemented alpha value for all bricks
    stopped listeners of all bricks when necessary
    Changed the manual solution to use the Android Quantity Strings.
    
    Implemented a Utils function that handles the double -> integer plurals
    problem and can be adapted, and works for at least english/ german in
    the upcoming release.
    
    Also added the distinction to the getPrototypeView() functions to
    prevent the template bricks displaying a different plurality than they
    get by default when inserted.
    refactored xmls to be clickable on prototype
    
    + id's for checkboxes
    fixed errors in xml files
    added checkboxes to bricks
    Implementation + Tests According to the documentation of the issue,
    working on my 4.1.1, Jenkins to do.

    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.
    set alpha values for setlookbrick and setxbrick views (also for spinner)
    temp. added animation
    removed double ns' in brick xml's
    set style of textviews to gravity center

    - [x] the background of the Buttons has a grid pattern drawn on it
    - [x] the Continue Button shows the name of the current project
    resolved conflict in brick_point_in_direction.xml
    update of licensetexts
    
    2010-2012 -> 2010-2013
    Removed unnecessary Schema declarations. Tests++
    
    * Now the heights of all buttons are checked.
    * Removed clutter from XML (thanks Kaufi)
    * Renamed _web to _community in Button ID
    
    TODO:
    * Colors either stay hardcoded in main_menu_button_background.xml or
      move to colors.xml, depending on whether they will be used elsewhere,
      once we know the final design for the other activities.
    * IDs of buttons need to be renamed accordingly once they have their
      final names
    Began Implementation of new MainMenu design
    
    * Added new font size xxlarge
    * Changed button styles accordingly
    * Added new colors
    * Added new placeholder icons (arrows)
    * Changed layout where necessary
    * Added test that checks if 'Continue' is around 50% bigger than others
    Removed 'Start' button from MainMenu. Deleted test
    
    * Removed the 'Start' button from the Actionbar in MainMenuActivity and
    removed it from the menu_main.xml file.
    * Deleted a test that started the stage from a landscape Main Menu.
    There is no landscape mode anymore for this activity, thus the test was
    deleted.
    
    Committing so I can run a test on Jenkins to find all occurances where
    'Start' is pressed.
    Removed last traces of old MainMenu strings.
    
    Commented out the old MainMenuActivity strings in all remaining
    languages to find all old occurances and adapted those.
    Drawable cleanup. Color cleanup. Now in grey/white
    
    * Deleted old drawables that are not used anymore in the new design.
    * Removed website_blue, replaced with 'white'.
    * Styles adopted to white/grey.
    Added new strings, deleted old ones.
    
    Removed the English and German strings that are supposedly used in
    MainMenuActivty, but weren't from what I can see. Then added the new
    ones with a prefix 'main_menu_'.
    
    Removed now obsolete icons, replaced them with <shape> drawables. To be
    found in /res/drawable. They are all the same but already have the
    correct names, so once the icons arrive, they can be just dropped in.
    Moved About and Settings to overflow menu
    
    Huge thanks go out to atermenji who wrote this code during his
    participation in the Google Summer of Code 2012. Due to internal
    decisions this could only be adopted now.

    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.
    greyed lots of other bricks

    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.

    fix inflater issues
    
    all fragments which are inflated using FragmentManager,
    need to use the three parameter inflate method with attachToRoot
    set to false; otherwise the app crashes with following error message:
    "The specified child already has a parent".
    Three parameter call of inflate is also used for adapters - see
    http://www.doubleencore.com/2013/05/layout-inflation-as-intended/.
    using the inflate method without setting attachToRoot caused
    "java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: addView(View, LayoutParams)
    is not supported in AdapterView"
    Optimized Layouts & emptyView implementation
    
    * Removed unnecessary overdraw where possible
    * Added the correct handling of empty ListViews for Scripts, Looks,

    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.
    greyed all bricks - finally
    Remove padding in Broadcast Bricks and PointToBrick
    Add tests for default Spinner values in BrickValueParameterTest
    removed double ns' in brick xml's
    Broadcast Bricks with option to create new Message from Spinner

    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.
    greyed out some bricks
    removed double ns' in brick xml's

    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.
    greyed all bricks - finally
    removed double ns' in brick xml's
    added layout id to bricks
    implemented alpha value for all bricks
    stopped listeners of all bricks when necessary

    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.
    greyed out some bricks
    changed brick styles accordingly
    removed double ns' in brick xml's
    added layout id to bricks
    implemented alpha value for all bricks
    stopped listeners of all bricks when necessary
    refactored xmls to be clickable on prototype
    
    + id's for checkboxes
    added checkboxes to bricks
    Remove some lint warnings
    
    * Replace '...' with '…' where necessary
    * Up maxSdk in Testprojects
    * Ignore one more category of lint issues in ABS
    * Remove debuggable flag from Manifests
    * Reorder tags in Manifests according to lint
    * Give some strings a more appropriate name
    * Delete unused strings
    * Set strings in strings-global.xml to translatable=false
    Refactored Look Brick XMLs
    
    Added style definitions for Look Bricks to styles.xml and applied them
    to all Look Bricks. Also changed some ids, therefore some java files
    needed to be modified.

    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.
    greyed out some bricks
    changed brick styles accordingly

    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.
    greyed lots of other bricks
    format xml files

    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.

    fix inflater issues
    
    all fragments which are inflated using FragmentManager,
    need to use the three parameter inflate method with attachToRoot
    set to false; otherwise the app crashes with following error message:
    "The specified child already has a parent".
    Three parameter call of inflate is also used for adapters - see
    http://www.doubleencore.com/2013/05/layout-inflation-as-intended/.

    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.

    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.
    greyed all bricks - finally
    removed double ns' in brick xml's

    Changed namespace for BrickLayout view to res-auto
    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.
    greyed all bricks - finally
    removed double ns' in brick xml's
    added layout id to bricks
    implemented alpha value for all bricks
    stopped listeners of all bricks when necessary
    refactored xmls to be clickable on prototype

    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.

    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.

     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.

    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.

    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.
    greyed lots of other bricks

    New workflow when creating a new object
    
    This will change the workflow when a new object is added. From now on
    there should be always a look be added too. Therefore the UX/UI Team
    decided to implement this two step dialog:
     1. Choose a new look from Paintroid (if installed), Gallery or Camera
     2. A preview of the selected look will be given and the user can enter
    the object's name
     3. If everything goes well the new object will be created and the app
    will jump into the new object's script activity
    
    Additionally if the user adds the new object within the script activity
    (PointToBrick) the user will be asked to jump to the new object.

    New workflow when creating a new object
    
    This will change the workflow when a new object is added. From now on
    there should be always a look be added too. Therefore the UX/UI Team
    decided to implement this two step dialog:
     1. Choose a new look from Paintroid (if installed), Gallery or Camera
     2. A preview of the selected look will be given and the user can enter
    the object's name
     3. If everything goes well the new object will be created and the app
    will jump into the new object's script activity
    
    Additionally if the user adds the new object within the script activity
    (PointToBrick) the user will be asked to jump to the new object.

    New workflow when creating a new object
    
    This will change the workflow when a new object is added. From now on
    there should be always a look be added too. Therefore the UX/UI Team
    decided to implement this two step dialog:
     1. Choose a new look from Paintroid (if installed), Gallery or Camera
     2. A preview of the selected look will be given and the user can enter
    the object's name
     3. If everything goes well the new object will be created and the app
    will jump into the new object's script activity
    
    Additionally if the user adds the new object within the script activity
    (PointToBrick) the user will be asked to jump to the new object.

    Reverted 2014 to 2013 in (c)
    
    testLicensePresentInAllFiles was failing, and it was easier to change
    2014 back to 2013 than to change the dates in *all* files in the
    repository now. This will have to be done in another branch ;-)

    * Settings menu moved to BaseActivity
    * Moved strings around where necessary
    * Adapted tests

    Fix #496, Rate app link in overflow menu
    
    The test is very minimalistic for a few reasons. On the emulator, there
    is no Play Store App, on a device there probably is, but clicking the
    menu would then leave Catroid. This would cause us to lose control over
    the test, because we're not in Catroid anymore.
    Renamed visible occurences of Catroid to Pocket Code
    resolved conflict in brick_point_in_direction.xml
    update of licensetexts
    
    2010-2012 -> 2010-2013
    Refactored method calls, moved method in MainMenu
    
    Refactored getActivity().getString() to solo.getString(), supposedly,
    this is the correct way to do it with Robotium.
    
    Moved actionBar.setTitle() from onResume() to onCreate().
    Removed 'Start' button from MainMenu. Deleted test
    
    * Removed the 'Start' button from the Actionbar in MainMenuActivity and
    removed it from the menu_main.xml file.
    * Deleted a test that started the stage from a landscape Main Menu.
    There is no landscape mode anymore for this activity, thus the test was
    deleted.
    
    Committing so I can run a test on Jenkins to find all occurances where
    'Start' is pressed.
    Added new strings, deleted old ones.
    
    Removed the English and German strings that are supposedly used in
    MainMenuActivty, but weren't from what I can see. Then added the new
    ones with a prefix 'main_menu_'.
    
    Removed now obsolete icons, replaced them with <shape> drawables. To be
    found in /res/drawable. They are all the same but already have the
    correct names, so once the icons arrive, they can be just dropped in.
    Moved About and Settings to overflow menu
    
    Huge thanks go out to atermenji who wrote this code during his
    participation in the Google Summer of Code 2012. Due to internal
    decisions this could only be adopted now.

    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.
    resolved conflict in brick_point_in_direction.xml

    Update Issue 211
    Added Japanese translation for category_lego_nxt.
    Renamed Consts to Constants and updated the references.
    
    As for the other languages which are missing some strings: We could kindly ask our GSoC students to translate some of them. But if the strings are not existent, the default - English - ones will be used. As our Russian/Romanian userbase is currently quite small, I suggest we neglect it for the moment, maybe even wait until we have a RC for v7 of Catroid, so we have a finalized version of strings.xml instead of adding, removing, correcting them every few commits.
    
    If you volunteer to translate the Japanese ones bit by bit, we can add Japanese to the unit tests, which look for untranslated strings (currently only active for German and English, as this is what 90%+ of our developers speak and can correct/add by themselves).

    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.

        and it shouldn't be possible to instantiate them.
        private constructor is hiding implicit public default constructor!!!

        according to several Code conventions/best practices

    refactoring needed because of renamed paintroid packages
    Update Issue 211
    Added Japanese translation for category_lego_nxt.
    Renamed Consts to Constants and updated the references.
    
    As for the other languages which are missing some strings: We could kindly ask our GSoC students to translate some of them. But if the strings are not existent, the default - English - ones will be used. As our Russian/Romanian userbase is currently quite small, I suggest we neglect it for the moment, maybe even wait until we have a RC for v7 of Catroid, so we have a finalized version of strings.xml instead of adding, removing, correcting them every few commits.
    
    If you volunteer to translate the Japanese ones bit by bit, we can add Japanese to the unit tests, which look for untranslated strings (currently only active for German and English, as this is what 90%+ of our developers speak and can correct/add by themselves).

    Update Issue 211
    Added Japanese translation for category_lego_nxt.
    Renamed Consts to Constants and updated the references.
    
    As for the other languages which are missing some strings: We could kindly ask our GSoC students to translate some of them. But if the strings are not existent, the default - English - ones will be used. As our Russian/Romanian userbase is currently quite small, I suggest we neglect it for the moment, maybe even wait until we have a RC for v7 of Catroid, so we have a finalized version of strings.xml instead of adding, removing, correcting them every few commits.
    
    If you volunteer to translate the Japanese ones bit by bit, we can add Japanese to the unit tests, which look for untranslated strings (currently only active for German and English, as this is what 90%+ of our developers speak and can correct/add by themselves).

    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.

    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.
    add eclipse pref for import order

    Update Issue 211
    Added Japanese translation for category_lego_nxt.
    Renamed Consts to Constants and updated the references.
    
    As for the other languages which are missing some strings: We could kindly ask our GSoC students to translate some of them. But if the strings are not existent, the default - English - ones will be used. As our Russian/Romanian userbase is currently quite small, I suggest we neglect it for the moment, maybe even wait until we have a RC for v7 of Catroid, so we have a finalized version of strings.xml instead of adding, removing, correcting them every few commits.
    
    If you volunteer to translate the Japanese ones bit by bit, we can add Japanese to the unit tests, which look for untranslated strings (currently only active for German and English, as this is what 90%+ of our developers speak and can correct/add by themselves).

    Issue 33: first changes for ABS
    Update Issue 211
    Added Japanese translation for category_lego_nxt.
    Renamed Consts to Constants and updated the references.
    
    As for the other languages which are missing some strings: We could kindly ask our GSoC students to translate some of them. But if the strings are not existent, the default - English - ones will be used. As our Russian/Romanian userbase is currently quite small, I suggest we neglect it for the moment, maybe even wait until we have a RC for v7 of Catroid, so we have a finalized version of strings.xml instead of adding, removing, correcting them every few commits.
    
    If you volunteer to translate the Japanese ones bit by bit, we can add Japanese to the unit tests, which look for untranslated strings (currently only active for German and English, as this is what 90%+ of our developers speak and can correct/add by themselves).
    ProjectScreenshotLoader (threaded), caching resized screenshots, small changes in ProjectAdapter (now with ProjectData)
    Issue 122: adapted test cases (MainMenuActivityTest & MyProjectsActivityTest)

    I want to note that it was _not_ broken and while this is a sanity check of the input, it was only added because the test cases do no mimic an actual user. Just sayin'
    Backed out of changeset 3670:593fd57a59db

    getSizeAsString finalized.

    enable more checkstyle rules and refactor code
    
    - remove nested blocks
    - change C style arrays to java style
    - long constants should be defined with upper L instead of l.
        l looks like the digit 1
    - add private constructor to utility classes!
        these classes contain only static methods/fields in their API,
        and it shouldn't be possible to instantiate them.
        private constructor is hiding implicit public default constructor!!!
    - classes with only private constructors should be declared final
    - each variable declaration should be in its own statement/own line
        according to several Code conventions/best practices
    - refactored Singletons
    removed unused version texts
    convert old language version to current on load
    New workflow when creating a new object
    
    This will change the workflow when a new object is added. From now on
    there should be always a look be added too. Therefore the UX/UI Team
    decided to implement this two step dialog:
     1. Choose a new look from Paintroid (if installed), Gallery or Camera
     2. A preview of the selected look will be given and the user can enter
    the object's name
     3. If everything goes well the new object will be created and the app
    will jump into the new object's script activity
    
    Additionally if the user adds the new object within the script activity
    (PointToBrick) the user will be asked to jump to the new object.
    Hide and show the SelectAll button appropriately

    Revert "TABVER-3"

    TABVER-3
    Added LoadProjectTask to show a ProgressDialog while loading thw project

    fixed one todo
    Added some methods
    refactor up- and download tests, remove NullPointerException and lint error+warnings
    Minor fix
    Finally fixed the bug causing download tests to fail
    Minor test fix
    Refactored StandardProjectHandler to implement a method that onoly creates and not saves a default project
    quickfix for not saving project all the time
    Minor error correction and refactoring
    Improved the implementation and refactored the tests for the compare functionality
    Implemented the comparisson between xml strings
    Changed the manual solution to use the Android Quantity Strings.
    
    Implemented a Utils function that handles the double -> integer plurals
    problem and can be adapted, and works for at least english/ german in
    the upcoming release.
    
    Also added the distinction to the getPrototypeView() functions to
    prevent the template bricks displaying a different plurality than they
    get by default when inserted.
    layout changes
    
    changed to relative layout
    sp instead of dp for text
    removed padding according to mockup
    refactor errorDialogFragment
    
    * remove unused imports (caused warnings)
    * remove ErrorDialogFragment class - not used any more
    removed Utils.displayErrorMessageFragment
    changed ProjectManager, Utils: showErrorDialog method added
    Imaplemented the comapre with the stanadard project
    Refactor some Util classes, added BottomBar class
    quickfix for image gallery load
    fix bug concerning adding of costumes
    rename "costume" into "look"
     * variables and filenames
    create Utils method
     * to activate/deactivate bottom bar
    resolved conflict in brick_point_in_direction.xml
    Hardened MainMenu against FCs without ext. storage
    
    * Added checks in onResume() and onDestroy() that can cause FCs in rare
      cases when there is no external storage available
    * projectManager member could be null because it was never initialized
      when there was no external storage available at the start of the app.
    * Strings modified to more accurately reflect what happens (too
      technical?)
    * App doesn't just System.exit(0) anymore but simply moves in the
      background. This was done to retain the Android paradigm of not
      killing your app manually, even though this is an unrecoverable state.
    Fixed crash when no SD Card is present
    
    * Check for SD Card improved. We now not only look for mounted media but
      also make sure it's not READ_ONLY. The new function name reflects
      that.
    * Added the check in MainMenuActivities onCreate() so we display an
      error message and quit gracefully instead of crashing.
    
    I tried to write a test for this using PowerMock + Mockito but did not
    succeed. In fact, I did not get to the point where I could even compile
    with these libraries added. Android Support was added to Mockito in
    1.9.5 but it seems there is no ready-to-use PowerMock package for
    Android. I encountered various errors while trying to make a runnable
    package.
    The other approach would be to rewrite the functions with e.g.
    Dependency Injection so we can insert e.g. a MockEnviroment to the Utils
    function or similar approaches.
    In the end, I decided to not do test-first in this case so this critical
    issue can get closed and find a way to test it later on.
    update of licensetexts
    
    2010-2012 -> 2010-2013
    Some fixes. buildProjectPath() 'fixed'
    
    * I made a boo-boo when refactoring
    * buildProjectPath() didn't work as I suspected and I made a minor
      mistake when using it. Should be fixed now
    First iteration of XML code cleanup
    
    * Mainly renamed variables to conform to our coding standard

    Reorganized resources, refactored StageDialog
    
    * Removed old icons of StageDialog
    * Added new drawables for StageDialog which will serve as placeholders
      until the final icons come

    Update Issue 211
    Added Japanese translation for category_lego_nxt.
    Renamed Consts to Constants and updated the references.
    
    As for the other languages which are missing some strings: We could kindly ask our GSoC students to translate some of them. But if the strings are not existent, the default - English - ones will be used. As our Russian/Romanian userbase is currently quite small, I suggest we neglect it for the moment, maybe even wait until we have a RC for v7 of Catroid, so we have a finalized version of strings.xml instead of adding, removing, correcting them every few commits.
    
    If you volunteer to translate the Japanese ones bit by bit, we can add Japanese to the unit tests, which look for untranslated strings (currently only active for German and English, as this is what 90%+ of our developers speak and can correct/add by themselves).

    Remove onStartCommand
    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.
    removed checkstyle warnings
    refactoring should be finished

        private constructor is hiding implicit public default constructor!!!

    Update Issue 211
    Added Japanese translation for category_lego_nxt.
    Renamed Consts to Constants and updated the references.
    
    As for the other languages which are missing some strings: We could kindly ask our GSoC students to translate some of them. But if the strings are not existent, the default - English - ones will be used. As our Russian/Romanian userbase is currently quite small, I suggest we neglect it for the moment, maybe even wait until we have a RC for v7 of Catroid, so we have a finalized version of strings.xml instead of adding, removing, correcting them every few commits.
    
    If you volunteer to translate the Japanese ones bit by bit, we can add Japanese to the unit tests, which look for untranslated strings (currently only active for German and English, as this is what 90%+ of our developers speak and can correct/add by themselves).

    As for the other languages which are missing some strings: We could kindly ask our GSoC students to translate some of them. But if the strings are not existent, the default - English - ones will be used. As our Russian/Romanian userbase is currently quite small, I suggest we neglect it for the moment, maybe even wait until we have a RC for v7 of Catroid, so we have a finalized version of strings.xml instead of adding, removing, correcting them every few commits.
    
    If you volunteer to translate the Japanese ones bit by bit, we can add Japanese to the unit tests, which look for untranslated strings (currently only active for German and English, as this is what 90%+ of our developers speak and can correct/add by themselves).

    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.

    Quickfix. No more double resizing of files.

    longer destroyed on copy (neat!).

    quick fix for issue#808: Editing copied images corrupts original images and other copies
    
    pass a copy (temp)of the image to paintroid.
    enable more checkstyle rules and refactor code
    
    - remove nested blocks
    - change C style arrays to java style
    - long constants should be defined with upper L instead of l.
        l looks like the digit 1
    - add private constructor to utility classes!
        these classes contain only static methods/fields in their API,
        and it shouldn't be possible to instantiate them.
        private constructor is hiding implicit public default constructor!!!
    - classes with only private constructors should be declared final
    - each variable declaration should be in its own statement/own line
        according to several Code conventions/best practices
    - refactored Singletons
    fixes the PointToBrickTest
    New workflow when creating a new object
    
    This will change the workflow when a new object is added. From now on
    there should be always a look be added too. Therefore the UX/UI Team
    decided to implement this two step dialog:
     1. Choose a new look from Paintroid (if installed), Gallery or Camera
     2. A preview of the selected look will be given and the user can enter
    the object's name
     3. If everything goes well the new object will be created and the app
    will jump into the new object's script activity
    
    Additionally if the user adds the new object within the script activity
    (PointToBrick) the user will be asked to jump to the new object.

    Refactor buildPath() calls in StorageHandler
    
    This is a small leftover from the gsoc_backpack branch merge.
    * Added static imports where I thought they were useful. The only thing
      I couldn't really decide was whether to make a static import for
      BUFFER_8K, so I left it as is. For the rest of the file, the context
      is clear and makes the code more readable.
    * Changed the preferences of when to use star imports. I was the one who
      changed it from 99 to 5. I see now how that was a mistake and it is
      hereby corrected.

     * variables and filenames
    Change object method XmlSerializer.toXml(Project, String) to static method.
    Removed NativeAppAct., had to refactor FullParser
    
    * Removed NativeAppActivity
    * Because I removed the NativeAppActivity I had errors in the project
      and tests, but not only in the native app tests but also in the XML
      Serializer and Parser Tests.
      NativeAppActivity was abused as a global place to get a Context from.
    * Refactored FullParser to only contain static methods and gave it a
      private constructor.
    * Moved a function from FullParser to new class XmlTestUtils because it
      was only used there. Class is package private (default accessibility
      modificator) because it's only used and meant to be used inside the
      XML test package.

    Fixed crash when no SD Card is present
    
    * Check for SD Card improved. We now not only look for mounted media but
      also make sure it's not READ_ONLY. The new function name reflects
      that.
    * Added the check in MainMenuActivities onCreate() so we display an
      error message and quit gracefully instead of crashing.
    
    I tried to write a test for this using PowerMock + Mockito but did not
    succeed. In fact, I did not get to the point where I could even compile
    with these libraries added. Android Support was added to Mockito in
    1.9.5 but it seems there is no ready-to-use PowerMock package for
    Android. I encountered various errors while trying to make a runnable
    package.
    The other approach would be to rewrite the functions with e.g.
    Dependency Injection so we can insert e.g. a MockEnviroment to the Utils
    function or similar approaches.
    In the end, I decided to not do test-first in this case so this critical
    issue can get closed and find a way to test it later on.

    Update Issue 211
    Added Japanese translation for category_lego_nxt.
    Renamed Consts to Constants and updated the references.
    
    As for the other languages which are missing some strings: We could kindly ask our GSoC students to translate some of them. But if the strings are not existent, the default - English - ones will be used. As our Russian/Romanian userbase is currently quite small, I suggest we neglect it for the moment, maybe even wait until we have a RC for v7 of Catroid, so we have a finalized version of strings.xml instead of adding, removing, correcting them every few commits.
    
    If you volunteer to translate the Japanese ones bit by bit, we can add Japanese to the unit tests, which look for untranslated strings (currently only active for German and English, as this is what 90%+ of our developers speak and can correct/add by themselves).

    enable more checkstyle rules and refactor code
    
    - remove nested blocks
    - change C style arrays to java style
    - long constants should be defined with upper L instead of l.
        l looks like the digit 1
    - add private constructor to utility classes!
        these classes contain only static methods/fields in their API,
        and it shouldn't be possible to instantiate them.
        private constructor is hiding implicit public default constructor!!!
    - classes with only private constructors should be declared final

        according to several Code conventions/best practices

    Removed NativeAppAct., had to refactor FullParser
    
    * Removed NativeAppActivity
    * Because I removed the NativeAppActivity I had errors in the project
      and tests, but not only in the native app tests but also in the XML
      Serializer and Parser Tests.
      NativeAppActivity was abused as a global place to get a Context from.
    * Refactored FullParser to only contain static methods and gave it a
      private constructor.
    * Moved a function from FullParser to new class XmlTestUtils because it
      was only used there. Class is package private (default accessibility
      modificator) because it's only used and meant to be used inside the
      XML test package.

    Fixed Issue 116
    Changed volumes from double to float, because in the end we need float, because that's what the Android API wants. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaPlayer.html#setVolume(float, float)
    
    Also, I was unable to think of a test for this, because while we can _set_ the volume of individual MediaPlayers, there is currently no way of getting it, besides remembering it.
    
    Update issue 116
    Owner: aried3r@gmail.com
    I fixed this issue, note however that the volume is a global one amongst all media players. When setting the volume to 100%, _all_ sounds in _all_ sprites will have 100%.

    New workflow when creating a new object
    
    This will change the workflow when a new object is added. From now on
    there should be always a look be added too. Therefore the UX/UI Team
    decided to implement this two step dialog:
     1. Choose a new look from Paintroid (if installed), Gallery or Camera
     2. A preview of the selected look will be given and the user can enter
    the object's name
     3. If everything goes well the new object will be created and the app
    will jump into the new object's script activity
    
    Additionally if the user adds the new object within the script activity
    (PointToBrick) the user will be asked to jump to the new object.

    fixed missing spaces in bricks
    added license texts and refactored some variables
    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.

    Fix issue #660
    
    Activate "Don't keep activities" in Developer options to reproduce this bug. When invoking the FormulaEditorFragment from the ScriptFragment it becomes registered with the ScriptActivity as the ScriptActivity is a FragmentActivity. Hence, when leaving the ScriptActivity by entering the stage and returning again by leaving the stage, it will try to resume its fragments. During this process it tries to access formulaTextFieldId of Formula.java. However this field is not available (= null) because it is declared transient. When not declaring the formulaTextFieldId as transient the NullPointerException will be avoided though the FormulaEditorFragment will be loaded anyway. Because all of this only happens when leaving the ScriptActivity via the PlayButton the FormulaEditorFragment is removed beforehand. So if now returning from stage the FormulaEditorFragment is not registered with the ScriptActivity and will not be started by the ScriptActivity.

    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.
    continued backpack

    enable more checkstyle rules and refactor code
    
    - remove nested blocks
    - change C style arrays to java style
    - long constants should be defined with upper L instead of l.
        l looks like the digit 1
    - add private constructor to utility classes!
        these classes contain only static methods/fields in their API,
        and it shouldn't be possible to instantiate them.
        private constructor is hiding implicit public default constructor!!!
    - classes with only private constructors should be declared final
    - each variable declaration should be in its own statement/own line
        according to several Code conventions/best practices
    - refactored Singletons
    Bottom bar hidden on action mode
    
    Fixes #641
    The BottomBar is now hidden everywhere where it is not intended to be,
    like renaming/deleting objects (instead of disabling the buttons in the
    Bottombar).
    Also the BottomBar.java class has changed. Now there are methods for
    showing and hiding the BottomBar and the Add+Play - Button.
    The Bottombar separator is now handled automatically by BottomBar.java
    (was: setting separator visibility manually where it was needed).

    Bottom bar hidden on action mode
    
    Fixes #641
    The BottomBar is now hidden everywhere where it is not intended to be,
    like renaming/deleting objects (instead of disabling the buttons in the
    Bottombar).
    Also the BottomBar.java class has changed. Now there are methods for
    showing and hiding the BottomBar and the Add+Play - Button.
    The Bottombar separator is now handled automatically by BottomBar.java
    (was: setting separator visibility manually where it was needed).

    Update Issue 211
    Added Japanese translation for category_lego_nxt.
    Renamed Consts to Constants and updated the references.
    
    As for the other languages which are missing some strings: We could kindly ask our GSoC students to translate some of them. But if the strings are not existent, the default - English - ones will be used. As our Russian/Romanian userbase is currently quite small, I suggest we neglect it for the moment, maybe even wait until we have a RC for v7 of Catroid, so we have a finalized version of strings.xml instead of adding, removing, correcting them every few commits.
    
    If you volunteer to translate the Japanese ones bit by bit, we can add Japanese to the unit tests, which look for untranslated strings (currently only active for German and English, as this is what 90%+ of our developers speak and can correct/add by themselves).

    Drone connection process implemented
    Drone functional additions + project setup:
    Functional
     - drone brick category
     - takeoff brick
     - settings option to enable/disable the drone bricks
     - drone support on PrestageActivity (incomplete)
    Project setup:
     - reference CatroidDrone from catroid (parrot source code)
     - Adde DroneControlService, dependent classes and native libraries
    change recording format to aac with extension m4a
    - refactored SoundRecorderTest: now waits for view change
    - bugfix for startSensorListener, redundant calls caused runtime exception
    - converted standard project audio files to aac
    - important fix for testIfBrickParts Test. Eliminated Timing problems
    New workflow when creating a new object
    
    This will change the workflow when a new object is added. From now on
    there should be always a look be added too. Therefore the UX/UI Team
    decided to implement this two step dialog:
     1. Choose a new look from Paintroid (if installed), Gallery or Camera
     2. A preview of the selected look will be given and the user can enter
    the object's name
     3. If everything goes well the new object will be created and the app
    will jump into the new object's script activity
    
    Additionally if the user adds the new object within the script activity
    (PointToBrick) the user will be asked to jump to the new object.
    Remove duplicate code, cleanup when possible
    
    * Settings menu moved to BaseActivity
    * Moved strings around where necessary
    * Adapted tests
    * Various little refactorings
    Bottom bar hidden on action mode
    
    Fixes #641
    The BottomBar is now hidden everywhere where it is not intended to be,
    like renaming/deleting objects (instead of disabling the buttons in the
    Bottombar).
    Also the BottomBar.java class has changed. Now there are methods for
    showing and hiding the BottomBar and the Add+Play - Button.
    The Bottombar separator is now handled automatically by BottomBar.java
    (was: setting separator visibility manually where it was needed).
    
    Jenkins Testrun(s):

    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.
    Introduce a BaseActivity
    
    * onDestroy() and unbindDrawables() now in BaseActivity where possible
    * onOptionsItemSelected() for android.R.id.home now in BaseActivity
    
    I changed the unbindDrawables() call to be more generic.

    writing and fixing tests
    add eclipse pref for import order
    
    - should be the same as in Android Studio
    - rename packages to lowercase
    refactoring should be finished
    implemented webview instead of browser intent
    
    this reverts #485, fixes #451
    some minor refactoring regarding urls done too
    messing around #2
    fix naming of variables/parameters/members/constants
    messing around with notifications
    Fix #496, Rate app link in overflow menu
    
    The test is very minimalistic for a few reasons. On the emulator, there
    is no Play Store App, on a device there probably is, but clicking the
    menu would then leave Catroid. This would cause us to lose control over
    the test, because we're not in Catroid anymore.
    Refactor singletons
    Fix issue#485
    
    Inserted notification dialog for community button.

    line endings conflict resolved
    Changes in MainMenuActivity according to the new Mockup:
    - [x] the icons are the same size
    - [x] the background of the Buttons has a grid pattern drawn on it
    - [x] the Continue Button shows the name of the current project
    MainMenuActivity refactored
    Shut down BT connection when returning to MainMenu
    
    This is a dirty quickfix, an issue will be created to look into this more closely.
    refactoring of MainMenuActivity
    
    * reorder methods
    * remove unused constructs (stage is not started from MainMenu any more)
    * project is only loaded once (in onResume())
    * some other refactoring
    resolved conflict in brick_point_in_direction.xml
    Hardened MainMenu against FCs without ext. storage
    
    * Added checks in onResume() and onDestroy() that can cause FCs in rare
      cases when there is no external storage available
    * projectManager member could be null because it was never initialized
      when there was no external storage available at the start of the app.
    * Strings modified to more accurately reflect what happens (too
      technical?)
    * App doesn't just System.exit(0) anymore but simply moves in the
      background. This was done to retain the Android paradigm of not
      killing your app manually, even though this is an unrecoverable state.
    Fixed crash when no SD Card is present
    
    * Check for SD Card improved. We now not only look for mounted media but
      also make sure it's not READ_ONLY. The new function name reflects
      that.
    * Added the check in MainMenuActivities onCreate() so we display an
      error message and quit gracefully instead of crashing.
    
    I tried to write a test for this using PowerMock + Mockito but did not
    succeed. In fact, I did not get to the point where I could even compile
    with these libraries added. Android Support was added to Mockito in
    1.9.5 but it seems there is no ready-to-use PowerMock package for
    Android. I encountered various errors while trying to make a runnable
    package.
    The other approach would be to rewrite the functions with e.g.
    Dependency Injection so we can insert e.g. a MockEnviroment to the Utils
    function or similar approaches.
    In the end, I decided to not do test-first in this case so this critical
    issue can get closed and find a way to test it later on.
    update of licensetexts
    
    2010-2012 -> 2010-2013
    previous changes undone
    trying to fix projectActivitytest
    Refactored method calls, moved method in MainMenu
    
    Refactored getActivity().getString() to solo.getString(), supposedly,
    this is the correct way to do it with Robotium.
    
    Moved actionBar.setTitle() from onResume() to onCreate().
    Title is now set to app_name, not project name
    
    Removed all setTitle() calls except the one in onResume() which I
    adapted to set the Actionbar title to the application name.
    Removed 'Start' button from MainMenu. Deleted test
    
    * Removed the 'Start' button from the Actionbar in MainMenuActivity and
    removed it from the menu_main.xml file.
    * Deleted a test that started the stage from a landscape Main Menu.
    There is no landscape mode anymore for this activity, thus the test was
    deleted.
    
    Committing so I can run a test on Jenkins to find all occurances where
    'Start' is pressed.
    Removed last traces of old MainMenu strings.
    
    Commented out the old MainMenuActivity strings in all remaining
    languages to find all old occurances and adapted those.
    Moved About and Settings to overflow menu
    
    Huge thanks go out to atermenji who wrote this code during his
    participation in the Google Summer of Code 2012. Due to internal
    decisions this could only be adopted now.

    ABS added to MainMenuActivity, ProjectActivity, MyProjectsActivity
    Update Issue 211
    Added Japanese translation for category_lego_nxt.
    Renamed Consts to Constants and updated the references.
    
    As for the other languages which are missing some strings: We could kindly ask our GSoC students to translate some of them. But if the strings are not existent, the default - English - ones will be used. As our Russian/Romanian userbase is currently quite small, I suggest we neglect it for the moment, maybe even wait until we have a RC for v7 of Catroid, so we have a finalized version of strings.xml instead of adding, removing, correcting them every few commits.
    
    If you volunteer to translate the Japanese ones bit by bit, we can add Japanese to the unit tests, which look for untranslated strings (currently only active for German and English, as this is what 90%+ of our developers speak and can correct/add by themselves).
    fixing: DELETE ALL THE PROJECTS Testcase - also fixed animation bug from ProjectActivity to MainMenuActivity - NewProjectDialog and AddSpriteDialog now offer the same user experience

    Bottom bar hidden on action mode
    
    Fixes #641
    The BottomBar is now hidden everywhere where it is not intended to be,
    like renaming/deleting objects (instead of disabling the buttons in the
    Bottombar).
    Also the BottomBar.java class has changed. Now there are methods for
    showing and hiding the BottomBar and the Add+Play - Button.
    The Bottombar separator is now handled automatically by BottomBar.java
    (was: setting separator visibility manually where it was needed).
    
    Jenkins Testrun(s):
    https://jenkins.catrob.at/job/Catroid-Multi-Job-Custom-Branch/355/
    
    Ran the failed ui test separatly 10 times:
    https://jenkins.catrob.at/view/Catroid/job/Catroid-single-UI-emulator/183/
    Actionbar title not updated
    
    When leaving the formula editor back to the script, the title in the Actionbar wasn't updated and still said "Formula Editor"
    
    - the previous Actionbar title is now delivered by the ProjectManager (currentSprite)
    
    - added Testcase to check the title in the Actionbar

    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.

    fix inflater issues
    
    all fragments which are inflated using FragmentManager,
    need to use the three parameter inflate method with attachToRoot
    set to false; otherwise the app crashes with following error message:
    "The specified child already has a parent".
    Three parameter call of inflate is also used for adapters - see
    http://www.doubleencore.com/2013/05/layout-inflation-as-intended/.

    "java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: addView(View, LayoutParams)
    is not supported in AdapterView"

    fix inflater issues
    
    all fragments which are inflated using FragmentManager,
    need to use the three parameter inflate method with attachToRoot
    set to false; otherwise the app crashes with following error message:
    "The specified child already has a parent".
    Three parameter call of inflate is also used for adapters - see
    http://www.doubleencore.com/2013/05/layout-inflation-as-intended/.
    using the inflate method without setting attachToRoot caused
    "java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: addView(View, LayoutParams)
    is not supported in AdapterView"
    Fix most of InflateParams, ignore others

    enable more checkstyle rules and refactor code
    
    - remove nested blocks
    - change C style arrays to java style
    - long constants should be defined with upper L instead of l.
        l looks like the digit 1
    - add private constructor to utility classes!
        these classes contain only static methods/fields in their API,
        and it shouldn't be possible to instantiate them.
        private constructor is hiding implicit public default constructor!!!
    - classes with only private constructors should be declared final
    - each variable declaration should be in its own statement/own line
        according to several Code conventions/best practices
    - refactored Singletons
    Hide and show the SelectAll button appropriately

    longer visible. Remove variable from strings.xml and hardcode 'Edit in
    Pocket Paint' in LookFragmentTest.
    
    Change 'assertEquals' to 'assertFalse'

    Unified the names of copied sounds and looks.
    Removed duplicate of copySound() method.
    Added description for copied sound in strings.xml .
    implemented multiple backpack per actionbar
    Bottom bar hidden on action mode
    
    Fixes #641
    The BottomBar is now hidden everywhere where it is not intended to be,
    like renaming/deleting objects (instead of disabling the buttons in the
    Bottombar).
    Also the BottomBar.java class has changed. Now there are methods for
    showing and hiding the BottomBar and the Add+Play - Button.
    The Bottombar separator is now handled automatically by BottomBar.java
    (was: setting separator visibility manually where it was needed).

    remove footer from costumeFragment
    
    as decided with the Usability Team, the clickable footerview is removed
    from all listviews
    remove parameter constructor
     * DialogFragments should only contain default constructors
    remove unused code
     * no additional optionsMenu items
     * adding functionality now in bottomBar
    create dialog for adding new costumes
     * choose between camera and gallery
     * needed to delete footer views
    quick fix
      * couldn't load CostumeFragment without this
    resolved conflict in brick_point_in_direction.xml
    Fixed crash when no SD Card is present
    
    * Check for SD Card improved. We now not only look for mounted media but
      also make sure it's not READ_ONLY. The new function name reflects
      that.
    * Added the check in MainMenuActivities onCreate() so we display an
      error message and quit gracefully instead of crashing.
    
    I tried to write a test for this using PowerMock + Mockito but did not
    succeed. In fact, I did not get to the point where I could even compile
    with these libraries added. Android Support was added to Mockito in
    1.9.5 but it seems there is no ready-to-use PowerMock package for
    Android. I encountered various errors while trying to make a runnable
    package.
    The other approach would be to rewrite the functions with e.g.
    Dependency Injection so we can insert e.g. a MockEnviroment to the Utils
    function or similar approaches.
    In the end, I decided to not do test-first in this case so this critical
    issue can get closed and find a way to test it later on.

    Update Issue 211
    Added Japanese translation for category_lego_nxt.
    Renamed Consts to Constants and updated the references.
    
    As for the other languages which are missing some strings: We could kindly ask our GSoC students to translate some of them. But if the strings are not existent, the default - English - ones will be used. As our Russian/Romanian userbase is currently quite small, I suggest we neglect it for the moment, maybe even wait until we have a RC for v7 of Catroid, so we have a finalized version of strings.xml instead of adding, removing, correcting them every few commits.
    
    If you volunteer to translate the Japanese ones bit by bit, we can add Japanese to the unit tests, which look for untranslated strings (currently only active for German and English, as this is what 90%+ of our developers speak and can correct/add by themselves).
    Update Issue 211
    Please see my changes. I think I covered everything we discussed. The only thing left is adding a translation of category_lego_nxt for Japanese.

    Bottom bar hidden on action mode
    
    Fixes #641
    The BottomBar is now hidden everywhere where it is not intended to be,
    like renaming/deleting objects (instead of disabling the buttons in the
    Bottombar).
    Also the BottomBar.java class has changed. Now there are methods for
    showing and hiding the BottomBar and the Add+Play - Button.
    The Bottombar separator is now handled automatically by BottomBar.java
    (was: setting separator visibility manually where it was needed).

    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.

    I tried to write a test for this using PowerMock + Mockito but did not
    succeed. In fact, I did not get to the point where I could even compile
    with these libraries added. Android Support was added to Mockito in
    1.9.5 but it seems there is no ready-to-use PowerMock package for
    Android. I encountered various errors while trying to make a runnable
    package.
    The other approach would be to rewrite the functions with e.g.
    Dependency Injection so we can insert e.g. a MockEnviroment to the Utils
    function or similar approaches.
    In the end, I decided to not do test-first in this case so this critical
    issue can get closed and find a way to test it later on.

    - change C style arrays to java style
    - long constants should be defined with upper L instead of l.
        l looks like the digit 1
    - add private constructor to utility classes!
        these classes contain only static methods/fields in their API,
        and it shouldn't be possible to instantiate them.
        private constructor is hiding implicit public default constructor!!!
    - classes with only private constructors should be declared final
    - each variable declaration should be in its own statement/own line
        according to several Code conventions/best practices
    - refactored Singletons
    Hide and show the SelectAll button appropriately
    remove unused modifier
    
    pmd reported unused modifier in these files!
    interface methods are implicitly abstract and public.
    interface attributes are implicitly public static final!!

    Bottom bar hidden on action mode
    
    Fixes #641
    The BottomBar is now hidden everywhere where it is not intended to be,
    like renaming/deleting objects (instead of disabling the buttons in the
    Bottombar).
    Also the BottomBar.java class has changed. Now there are methods for
    showing and hiding the BottomBar and the Add+Play - Button.
    The Bottombar separator is now handled automatically by BottomBar.java
    (was: setting separator visibility manually where it was needed).
    
    Jenkins Testrun(s):
    https://jenkins.catrob.at/job/Catroid-Multi-Job-Custom-Branch/355/
    
    Ran the failed ui test separatly 10 times:

    fixed Bug in SoundAdapter
    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.

    Fixed crash when no SD Card is present
    
    * Check for SD Card improved. We now not only look for mounted media but
      also make sure it's not READ_ONLY. The new function name reflects
      that.
    * Added the check in MainMenuActivities onCreate() so we display an
      error message and quit gracefully instead of crashing.
    
    I tried to write a test for this using PowerMock + Mockito but did not
    succeed. In fact, I did not get to the point where I could even compile
    with these libraries added. Android Support was added to Mockito in
    1.9.5 but it seems there is no ready-to-use PowerMock package for
    Android. I encountered various errors while trying to make a runnable
    package.
    The other approach would be to rewrite the functions with e.g.
    Dependency Injection so we can insert e.g. a MockEnviroment to the Utils
    function or similar approaches.
    In the end, I decided to not do test-first in this case so this critical
    issue can get closed and find a way to test it later on.

    Fixes #641
    The BottomBar is now hidden everywhere where it is not intended to be,
    like renaming/deleting objects (instead of disabling the buttons in the
    Bottombar).
    Also the BottomBar.java class has changed. Now there are methods for
    showing and hiding the BottomBar and the Add+Play - Button.
    The Bottombar separator is now handled automatically by BottomBar.java
    (was: setting separator visibility manually where it was needed).

    Bottom bar hidden on action mode
    
    Fixes #641
    The BottomBar is now hidden everywhere where it is not intended to be,
    like renaming/deleting objects (instead of disabling the buttons in the
    Bottombar).
    Also the BottomBar.java class has changed. Now there are methods for
    showing and hiding the BottomBar and the Add+Play - Button.
    The Bottombar separator is now handled automatically by BottomBar.java
    (was: setting separator visibility manually where it was needed).
    
    Jenkins Testrun(s):
    https://jenkins.catrob.at/job/Catroid-Multi-Job-Custom-Branch/355/

    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.
    remove copy Button from BrickCategoryFragment and AddBrickFragment
    add eclipse pref for import order

    Tapping on a "When..." brick now opens the same contextmenu, that is opened when tapping on all other bricks.
    
    - Tapping on a "When..." brick is now handled by the BrickAdapter (onClickListener)
    
    - Deleted onCreateContextMenu and onContextItemSelected from ScriptFragment, since they are no longer needed
    
    - Changed all Tests, where "When..." bricks are tested (onLongClick -> onClick)
    
    - Changed all Tests, where a click on a "When..." brick is used to gain focus

    Fixed crash when no SD Card is present
    
    * Check for SD Card improved. We now not only look for mounted media but
      also make sure it's not READ_ONLY. The new function name reflects
      that.
    * Added the check in MainMenuActivities onCreate() so we display an
      error message and quit gracefully instead of crashing.
    
    I tried to write a test for this using PowerMock + Mockito but did not
    succeed. In fact, I did not get to the point where I could even compile
    with these libraries added. Android Support was added to Mockito in
    1.9.5 but it seems there is no ready-to-use PowerMock package for
    Android. I encountered various errors while trying to make a runnable
    package.
    The other approach would be to rewrite the functions with e.g.
    Dependency Injection so we can insert e.g. a MockEnviroment to the Utils
    function or similar approaches.
    In the end, I decided to not do test-first in this case so this critical
    issue can get closed and find a way to test it later on.
    Began Refactoring of Motion brick XMLs

    Update Issue 211
    Added Japanese translation for category_lego_nxt.
    Renamed Consts to Constants and updated the references.
    
    As for the other languages which are missing some strings: We could kindly ask our GSoC students to translate some of them. But if the strings are not existent, the default - English - ones will be used. As our Russian/Romanian userbase is currently quite small, I suggest we neglect it for the moment, maybe even wait until we have a RC for v7 of Catroid, so we have a finalized version of strings.xml instead of adding, removing, correcting them every few commits.
    
    If you volunteer to translate the Japanese ones bit by bit, we can add Japanese to the unit tests, which look for untranslated strings (currently only active for German and English, as this is what 90%+ of our developers speak and can correct/add by themselves).

    - own xml file
    - pocketPaintButton allways visible
    - pocketPaintInstallDialog moved to the front.
    New workflow when creating a new object
    
    This will change the workflow when a new object is added. From now on
    there should be always a look be added too. Therefore the UX/UI Team
    decided to implement this two step dialog:
     1. Choose a new look from Paintroid (if installed), Gallery or Camera
     2. A preview of the selected look will be given and the user can enter
    the object's name
     3. If everything goes well the new object will be created and the app
    will jump into the new object's script activity
    
    Additionally if the user adds the new object within the script activity
    (PointToBrick) the user will be asked to jump to the new object.

    Update Issue 211
    Added Japanese translation for category_lego_nxt.
    Renamed Consts to Constants and updated the references.
    
    As for the other languages which are missing some strings: We could kindly ask our GSoC students to translate some of them. But if the strings are not existent, the default - English - ones will be used. As our Russian/Romanian userbase is currently quite small, I suggest we neglect it for the moment, maybe even wait until we have a RC for v7 of Catroid, so we have a finalized version of strings.xml instead of adding, removing, correcting them every few commits.
    
    If you volunteer to translate the Japanese ones bit by bit, we can add Japanese to the unit tests, which look for untranslated strings (currently only active for German and English, as this is what 90%+ of our developers speak and can correct/add by themselves).

    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.
    add eclipse pref for import order
    
    - should be the same as in Android Studio

    Added Japanese translation for category_lego_nxt.
    Renamed Consts to Constants and updated the references.
    
    As for the other languages which are missing some strings: We could kindly ask our GSoC students to translate some of them. But if the strings are not existent, the default - English - ones will be used. As our Russian/Romanian userbase is currently quite small, I suggest we neglect it for the moment, maybe even wait until we have a RC for v7 of Catroid, so we have a finalized version of strings.xml instead of adding, removing, correcting them every few commits.
    
    If you volunteer to translate the Japanese ones bit by bit, we can add Japanese to the unit tests, which look for untranslated strings (currently only active for German and English, as this is what 90%+ of our developers speak and can correct/add by themselves).

    New workflow when creating a new object
    
    This will change the workflow when a new object is added. From now on
    there should be always a look be added too. Therefore the UX/UI Team
    decided to implement this two step dialog:
     1. Choose a new look from Paintroid (if installed), Gallery or Camera
     2. A preview of the selected look will be given and the user can enter
    the object's name
     3. If everything goes well the new object will be created and the app
    will jump into the new object's script activity
    
    Additionally if the user adds the new object within the script activity
    (PointToBrick) the user will be asked to jump to the new object.

    change dialog style and layout for all custom dialogs

    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.
    add eclipse pref for import order

        these classes contain only static methods/fields in their API,
        and it shouldn't be possible to instantiate them.
        private constructor is hiding implicit public default constructor!!!

    - each variable declaration should be in its own statement/own line
        according to several Code conventions/best practices

    enable more checkstyle rules and refactor code
    
    - remove nested blocks
    - change C style arrays to java style
    - long constants should be defined with upper L instead of l.
        l looks like the digit 1
    - add private constructor to utility classes!
        these classes contain only static methods/fields in their API,
        and it shouldn't be possible to instantiate them.
        private constructor is hiding implicit public default constructor!!!
    - classes with only private constructors should be declared final
    - each variable declaration should be in its own statement/own line
        according to several Code conventions/best practices
    - refactored Singletons
    convert old language version to current on load
    New workflow when creating a new object
    
    This will change the workflow when a new object is added. From now on
    there should be always a look be added too. Therefore the UX/UI Team
    decided to implement this two step dialog:
     1. Choose a new look from Paintroid (if installed), Gallery or Camera
     2. A preview of the selected look will be given and the user can enter
    the object's name
     3. If everything goes well the new object will be created and the app
    will jump into the new object's script activity
    
    Additionally if the user adds the new object within the script activity
    (PointToBrick) the user will be asked to jump to the new object.

    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.
    Display if a variable is local or global
    
    The Variable list now has 2 headers to distinguish between local and global variables.
    
    - added fragment_formula_editor_variablelist_global_headline.xml and fragment_formula_editor_variablelist_local_headline.xml. These .xml files are included in fragment_formula_editor_variablelist_item.xml and used to display the headlines.
    
    - added strings for headlines in strings.xml files in /values and /values-de
    
    - added styles for headlines in style.xml
    
    - changed the getView method of the UserVariableAdapter, so that headlines are displayed at the correct position
    
    - added testVariableListHeadlines() in FormulaEditorUserVariableFragmentTest.java to test if headlines are correctly displayed
    
    - added method createUserVariableFromVariableFragment in FormulaEditorUserVariableFragmentTest.java
    
    - deleted method finishUserVariableCreationSafeButSlow, (-> createUserVariableFromVariableFragment is used to create variables)
    
    - Refactored testmethods in FormulaEditorUserVariableFragmentTest
    add eclipse pref for import order
    
    - should be the same as in Android Studio
    - rename packages to lowercase
    Change comparison in getPositionOfItem in UserVariableAdapter
    
    After copy ''item'' would be a different object. As we only want to know
    the position of ''item'' in the adapter a comparison of the names is
    sufficient.

    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.

    Update gradle, android plugin, support library,...
    
    * Gradle (wrapper) updated from 1.11 to 1.12
    * Gradle Android plugin updated from 0.9.+ to 0.11.+
    * Support Library updated from 18.0.+ to 19.1.0
    * Build Tools updated from 19 to 19.1.0
    * NEW plugin android-sdk-manager, will download new build tools, SDK
      versions,... as declared in `build.gradle` on demand
    * Checkstyle is now part of the `build` lifecycle
    * `gradle.properties` file added, includes the daemon and parallel
      execution. AFAIK this is not honoured by AS as it has its own settings
      and uses the daemon by default, but it speeds up commandline builds
      (not clean builds but incremental ones). Benchmarks below.
    * Had to change the classpath variable of the checkstyle task because
      otherwise it wouldn't compile for me. Works on my machine doing `gw
      checkstyle`.
    
    Benchmarks:
    Not parallel:
    ```
    gw clean:
    Total time: 13.921 secs

    Total time: 5.357 secs
    
    gw assDe:
    Total time: 3.644 secs
    ```
    
    Results:
    `gw clean build` is a bit faster, but not by a lot, `clean` is a
    lot faster, as are subsequent incremental builds (note: not really an
    incremental build in this case, because the source wasn't modified at
    all). I use these settings at work on the console and did not encounter
    any problems so far. For parallel builds in Android Studio, see the
    compiler settings there.
    
    Notes:
    I use `gw` instead of `./gradlew` or `../gradlew` (see [this][1] post
    by Jakewharton for more info) as well as [task name abbreviation][2] in
    case you wonder what exactly I am doing in the benchmarks, `assDe` = `assembleDebug`.

    issue#33
    correct faulty nesting brick references on loadProject
    enable more checkstyle rules and refactor code
    
    - remove nested blocks
    - change C style arrays to java style
    - long constants should be defined with upper L instead of l.
        l looks like the digit 1
    - add private constructor to utility classes!
        these classes contain only static methods/fields in their API,
        and it shouldn't be possible to instantiate them.
        private constructor is hiding implicit public default constructor!!!
    - classes with only private constructors should be declared final
    - each variable declaration should be in its own statement/own line
        according to several Code conventions/best practices
    - refactored Singletons
    remove unused modifier
    
    pmd reported unused modifier in these files!
    interface methods are implicitly abstract and public.
    interface attributes are implicitly public static final!!
    Select only NestingBricks in action mode
    Changes to BrickAdapter and CAB Title; renamings
    
    * Simplify and rename Interface in BrickAdapter
    * Display correct title in CAB
    * Add tests for Copy ActionMode Title
    * Renamed plural strings
    * Throw IllegalArgumentAcception when there's an unhandled tag
    Remove call to saveProject in addNewBrick
    
    saveProject should not be called whenever a brick is added. Every new brick added
    would cause the project to be saved which would take some thime if the project
    already has many objects.
    Fix several issues concerning NestingBricks and ActionMode
    add CustomAlertDialogBuilder
     Remove unnecessary calls to getString()
    add select all to ScriptFragment
    add layout xml for select all

    Fix incorrect text in Dialogue for "When..." bricks.
    
    changed "Delete Brick" to "Delete Script" in the context menu and "Delete this brick?" to "Delete this script?" in the ensuing dialog for "When..." bricks.
    
    - added strings for dialogue in strings.xml
    
    - added the setting of the strings in the BrickAdapter (onClickListener)
    
    - refactored Tests for "When..." bricks
    Open contextmenu when tapping "When..." bricks
    
    Tapping on a "When..." brick now opens the same contextmenu, that is opened when tapping on all other bricks.
    
    - Tapping on a "When..." brick is now handled by the BrickAdapter (onClickListener)
    
    - Deleted onCreateContextMenu and onContextItemSelected from ScriptFragment, since they are no longer needed
    
    - Changed all Tests, where "When..." bricks are tested (onLongClick -> onClick)
    
    - Changed all Tests, where a click on a "When..." brick is used to gain focus

    - hack: triggers events directly in onInterceptTouchEvent in
    DragAndDropListView. This is necessary because getView() is not always
    triggered automatically

    cat-862 #fixed
    updated license and scope
    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.
    add eclipse pref for import order
    
    - should be the same as in Android Studio

    enable more checkstyle rules and refactor code
    
    - remove nested blocks
    - change C style arrays to java style
    - long constants should be defined with upper L instead of l.
        l looks like the digit 1
    - add private constructor to utility classes!
        these classes contain only static methods/fields in their API,
        and it shouldn't be possible to instantiate them.
        private constructor is hiding implicit public default constructor!!!
    - classes with only private constructors should be declared final
    - each variable declaration should be in its own statement/own line
        according to several Code conventions/best practices
    - refactored Singletons
    add eclipse pref for import order
    
    - should be the same as in Android Studio
    - rename packages to lowercase

    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.

    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.

    updated license and scope
    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.
    add eclipse pref for import order
    
    - should be the same as in Android Studio

    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.

    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.
    add eclipse pref for import order

    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.
    add eclipse pref for import order

    - add private constructor to utility classes!
        these classes contain only static methods/fields in their API,
        and it shouldn't be possible to instantiate them.
        private constructor is hiding implicit public default constructor!!!
    - classes with only private constructors should be declared final
    - each variable declaration should be in its own statement/own line
        according to several Code conventions/best practices
    - refactored Singletons
    New workflow when creating a new object
    
    This will change the workflow when a new object is added. From now on
    there should be always a look be added too. Therefore the UX/UI Team
    decided to implement this two step dialog:
     1. Choose a new look from Paintroid (if installed), Gallery or Camera
     2. A preview of the selected look will be given and the user can enter
    the object's name
     3. If everything goes well the new object will be created and the app

    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.

    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.

    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.
    add eclipse pref for import order
    
    - should be the same as in Android Studio

    CostumeAdapter and CostumeActivity Refactoring done.
    
    This issue is now on hold, because the current version of Paintroid won't let me reproduce the problem. Waiting for the cropping feature to be implemented.
    Fixed Issue 116
    Changed volumes from double to float, because in the end we need float, because that's what the Android API wants. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaPlayer.html#setVolume(float, float)
    
    Also, I was unable to think of a test for this, because while we can _set_ the volume of individual MediaPlayers, there is currently no way of getting it, besides remembering it.
    
    Update issue 116
    Owner: aried3r@gmail.com
    I fixed this issue, note however that the volume is a global one amongst all media players. When setting the volume to 100%, _all_ sounds in _all_ sprites will have 100%.

    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.
    add eclipse pref for import order

    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.
    add eclipse pref for import order

    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.
    add eclipse pref for import order
    
    - should be the same as in Android Studio

    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.
    add eclipse pref for import order

    Fix several issues concerning NestingBricks and ActionMode
    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.
    add eclipse pref for import order

    Removed NativeAppAct., had to refactor FullParser
    
    * Removed NativeAppActivity
    * Because I removed the NativeAppActivity I had errors in the project
      and tests, but not only in the native app tests but also in the XML
      Serializer and Parser Tests.
      NativeAppActivity was abused as a global place to get a Context from.
    * Refactored FullParser to only contain static methods and gave it a
      private constructor.
    * Moved a function from FullParser to new class XmlTestUtils because it
      was only used there. Class is package private (default accessibility
      modificator) because it's only used and meant to be used inside the
      XML test package.

    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.

    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.
    add eclipse pref for import order

    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.

    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.
    add eclipse pref for import order

    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.
    add eclipse pref for import order

    brick with edit text and dialogs fix (crashed on edit attemt)
    Fixed Issue 116
    Changed volumes from double to float, because in the end we need float, because that's what the Android API wants. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaPlayer.html#setVolume(float, float)
    
    Also, I was unable to think of a test for this, because while we can _set_ the volume of individual MediaPlayers, there is currently no way of getting it, besides remembering it.
    
    Update issue 116
    Owner: aried3r@gmail.com
    I fixed this issue, note however that the volume is a global one amongst all media players. When setting the volume to 100%, _all_ sounds in _all_ sprites will have 100%.

    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.
    add eclipse pref for import order

    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.

    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.
    add eclipse pref for import order
    
    - should be the same as in Android Studio

    prevent the template bricks displaying a different plurality than they
    get by default when inserted.

    TextFields not using space on larger devices
    
    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.
    add eclipse pref for import order
    
    - should be the same as in Android Studio

    fixes #570
    I created a new ViewGroup called BrickLayout which replaces
    LinearLayout(s) inside the bricks. It follows the specifications given
    by the UX designers:
     1. text fields all have the same maximum size.
     2. text fields use the maximum amount of space possible
     3. on small screens, use line breaks to maximize text field width. On large
        screens, eliminate as many line breaks as possible.
     4. the line breaks are static, I.E., determined at the time the brick is
        shown for the first time, never reshuffled as the text field sizes
        change.
    
    I ended up changing all the EditTexts on bricks to TextViews to solve
    the elipsizing problem, and as a result, I updated the
    EditTextAlignmentTest to reflect those changes.
    add eclipse pref for import order

    * Removed NativeAppActivity
    * Because I removed the NativeAppActivity I had errors in the project
      and tests, but not only in the native app tests but also in the XML
      Serializer and Parser Tests.
      NativeAppActivity was abused as a global place to get a Context from.
    * Refactored FullParser to only contain static methods and gave it a
      private constructor.
    * Moved a function from FullParser to new class XmlTestUtils because it
      was only used there. Class is package private (default accessibility
      modificator) because it's only used and meant to be used inside the
      XML test package.

    Adding default constructors and changing object creator to use them
    Fixed Issue 116
    Changed volumes from double to float, because in the end we need float, because that's what the Android API wants. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaPlayer.html#setVolume(float, float)
    
    Also, I was unable to think of a test for this, because while we can _set_ the volume of individual MediaPlayers, there is currently no way of getting it, besides remembering it.
    
    Update issue 116
    Owner: aried3r@gmail.com
    I fixed this issue, note however that the volume is a global one amongst all media players. When setting the volume to 100%, _all_ sounds in _all_ sprites will have 100%.

    - change C style arrays to java style
    - long constants should be defined with upper L instead of l.
        l looks like the digit 1
    - add private constructor to utility classes!
        these classes contain only static methods/fields in their API,
        and it shouldn't be possible to instantiate them.
        private constructor is hiding implicit public default constructor!!!
    - classes with only private constructors should be declared final
    - each variable declaration should be in its own statement/own line
        according to several Code conventions/best practices
    - refactored Singletons
    change testserver URL

    As for the other languages which are missing some strings: We could kindly ask our GSoC students to translate some of them. But if the strings are not existent, the default - English - ones will be used. As our Russian/Romanian userbase is currently quite small, I suggest we neglect it for the moment, maybe even wait until we have a RC for v7 of Catroid, so we have a finalized version of strings.xml instead of adding, removing, correcting them every few commits.
    
    If you volunteer to translate the Japanese ones bit by bit, we can add Japanese to the unit tests, which look for untranslated strings (currently only active for German and English, as this is what 90%+ of our developers speak and can correct/add by themselves).

    Fix upload of large projects
    
    * Updated http-request to 5.4.1 (necessary for ConnectionFactory)
    * Added okhttp 1.1.1
    * The fix itself is twofold:
      First, I enabled chunked uploading (Tranfser-Encoding: chunked).
      This didn't quite work with a 85MB project, I debugged as well as I
      could, then tested through a proxy on my dev machine to see the
      request headers. As soon as I used a proxy, it worked. So the error
      was gone once I tried to take a closer look.
      I did not bother trying tcpdump or similar on the phone itself.
    
      Secondly, I tried using OkHttp instead of the normal HttpClient with
      http-request, this worked out of the box, even without the proxy. I
      then tried to upload the same 85MB project on the production server
      which did not work (it aborted after 60 seconds).
      Turns out, SPDY is enabled on the production server and OkHttp tries
      to use the best available protocol (SPDY). Forcing HTTP 1.1 makes it
      work.
    
    Advantages of using OkHttp: It's (supposedly) the best HttpClient
    around, even got accepted back into AOSP.
    https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/okhttp/
    Also it provides a consistent implementation on all versions of Android
    where our app is installed. OkHttp supports Android 2.2 and above.
    
    tl;dr: I have no idea what is actually fixing this issue. :D

    Fixed crash when no SD Card is present
    
    * Check for SD Card improved. We now not only look for mounted media but
      also make sure it's not READ_ONLY. The new function name reflects
      that.
    * Added the check in MainMenuActivities onCreate() so we display an
      error message and quit gracefully instead of crashing.
    
    I tried to write a test for this using PowerMock + Mockito but did not
    succeed. In fact, I did not get to the point where I could even compile
    with these libraries added. Android Support was added to Mockito in
    1.9.5 but it seems there is no ready-to-use PowerMock package for
    Android. I encountered various errors while trying to make a runnable
    package.
    The other approach would be to rewrite the functions with e.g.
    Dependency Injection so we can insert e.g. a MockEnviroment to the Utils
    function or similar approaches.
    In the end, I decided to not do test-first in this case so this critical
    issue can get closed and find a way to test it later on.

    Update Issue 211
    Added Japanese translation for category_lego_nxt.
    Renamed Consts to Constants and updated the references.
    
    As for the other languages which are missing some strings: We could kindly ask our GSoC students to translate some of them. But if the strings are not existent, the default - English - ones will be used. As our Russian/Romanian userbase is currently quite small, I suggest we neglect it for the moment, maybe even wait until we have a RC for v7 of Catroid, so we have a finalized version of strings.xml instead of adding, removing, correcting them every few commits.
    
    If you volunteer to translate the Japanese ones bit by bit, we can add Japanese to the unit tests, which look for untranslated strings (currently only active for German and English, as this is what 90%+ of our developers speak and can correct/add by themselves).

    of the first in the render() method of the StageListener, because the
    ScreenUtils.getFrameBufferPixels() method used to get the pixels,
    returns an all white picture in ~1/5 trys and this was untestable.(And
    not intended behaviour)
    The Issue itself should be resolved, Still TODO: Remove Log.d() messages

    enable more checkstyle rules and refactor code
    
    - remove nested blocks
    - change C style arrays to java style
    - long constants should be defined with upper L instead of l.
        l looks like the digit 1
    - add private constructor to utility classes!
        these classes contain only static methods/fields in their API,
        and it shouldn't be possible to instantiate them.
        private constructor is hiding implicit public default constructor!!!
    - classes with only private constructors should be declared final
    - each variable declaration should be in its own statement/own line
        according to several Code conventions/best practices
    - refactored Singletons
    refactor resource handling, fix import of soundfile in standard project, refactor ImageEditing, fix tests and deactivate a BackPackSound test

    Cleaned up debug log messages and removed warnings
    The issue should be resolved with this commit, still debug messages to
    get rid of.
    
    Important Change: Had to take the screenshot at the second frame instead
    of the first in the render() method of the StageListener, because the
    ScreenUtils.getFrameBufferPixels() method used to get the pixels,
    returns an all white picture in ~1/5 trys and this was untestable.(And
    not intended behaviour)
    The Issue itself should be resolved, Still TODO: Remove Log.d() messages
    and write automatic tests, .R import order
    Removed NativeAppAct., had to refactor FullParser
    
    * Removed NativeAppActivity
    * Because I removed the NativeAppActivity I had errors in the project
      and tests, but not only in the native app tests but also in the XML
      Serializer and Parser Tests.
      NativeAppActivity was abused as a global place to get a Context from.
    * Refactored FullParser to only contain static methods and gave it a
      private constructor.
    * Moved a function from FullParser to new class XmlTestUtils because it
      was only used there. Class is package private (default accessibility
      modificator) because it's only used and meant to be used inside the
      XML test package.

    Stage SensorHandler fix
    merge complete
    Refactored StageActivity/-Dialog/-Listener
    Cleaned up debug log messages and removed warnings
    The issue should be resolved with this commit, still debug messages to
    get rid of.
    
    Important Change: Had to take the screenshot at the second frame instead
    of the first in the render() method of the StageListener, because the
    ScreenUtils.getFrameBufferPixels() method used to get the pixels,
    returns an all white picture in ~1/5 trys and this was untestable.(And
    not intended behaviour)
    The Issue itself should be resolved, Still TODO: Remove Log.d() messages
    and write automatic tests, .R import order
    Modify Keep Screen On code in Stage
    
    * Use addFlags() instead of setFlags()

    This is a small leftover from the gsoc_backpack branch merge.
    * Added static imports where I thought they were useful. The only thing

      BUFFER_8K, so I left it as is. For the rest of the file, the context
      is clear and makes the code more readable.
    * Changed the preferences of when to use star imports. I was the one who
      changed it from 99 to 5. I see now how that was a mistake and it is
      hereby corrected.

    adapt license files
    
    additionally enable more logoutput for sourcetests in console
    change static import order
    update gradle check task
    
    - move checkstyle and lint config files to new config folder
    - remove .checkstyle files, which are only needed for Eclipse
    - output folder for lint and checkstyle results set to build/reports
    - activate pmd 5.1.1 (gradle 1.12 default is 4.3)
    - toolVersion property is deprecated - but haven't found a workaround
    - rulesets with excluded rules are moved to specific
    ruleset files containing only one ruleset.
    one general ruleset file did not work - excluded rules were ignored.
    see http://stackoverflow.com/a/23546851/2093483
    - gradle check task now executes pmd as well
    enable more checkstyle rules and refactor code
    
    - remove nested blocks
    - change C style arrays to java style
    - long constants should be defined with upper L instead of l.
        l looks like the digit 1
    - add private constructor to utility classes!
        these classes contain only static methods/fields in their API,
        and it shouldn't be possible to instantiate them.
        private constructor is hiding implicit public default constructor!!!
    - classes with only private constructors should be declared final
    - each variable declaration should be in its own statement/own line
        according to several Code conventions/best practices
    - refactored Singletons

    fix inflater issues
    
    all fragments which are inflated using FragmentManager,
    need to use the three parameter inflate method with attachToRoot
    set to false; otherwise the app crashes with following error message:
    "The specified child already has a parent".
    Three parameter call of inflate is also used for adapters - see
    http://www.doubleencore.com/2013/05/layout-inflation-as-intended/.
    using the inflate method without setting attachToRoot caused
    "java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: addView(View, LayoutParams)
    is not supported in AdapterView"
    refactor Lint options
    
    - only specific Lint ignores reside in lint.xml
    - remove unused res-folders
    - ignore unused drone.png file - code currently commented
    - some code formatting (auto formatter)
    Fix most of InflateParams, ignore others
