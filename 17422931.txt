    change the project name in rock init (from xsens into xsens_imu
    reorganise the code: rename library from 'xsens' into 'xsens_imu', use the current rock library structure, move the vendor library into external folder, replace cmake command with rock macros
    Eigen adaptations
    update to eigen3
    fix dependency name for Eigen
    dist: remove dead CMake code
    split between calibration and sample reading mode
    
    The calibration mode outputs a binary file that can be used
    later on with Xsens calibration software.
    vendor library is now static
    
    otherwise it is quite annoying that you have to link two different libraries
    split types definitions from class declaration
    
    this is to make life easier for orogon
    Advenced Driver in various ways
    
    added ability to configure mode of IMU to : only send calibrated data, only send orientation, send both
    added getter for orientation
    added getter for accelerometer data
    added getter for gyroscope data
    added getter for magnetometer data
    added error codes
    added documentation of functions
    
    moved debug output to Test
    Implemented simple driver using vendor lib
    
    Simple driver was implemented, that opens the device
    and reads out orientaten and calibrated data
    added inital files for driver
    Use CMake variables and methods instead of library name (pthread) directly
    Compile fix: Adds pthread to the libraries that have to be linked.
    include previous executable test

    Updated vendor lib to latest version
    
    Updated vencor lib to the version from the MT SDK 3.3
    vendor library is now static
    
    otherwise it is quite annoying that you have to link two different libraries
    added Vendor lib
    
    added Vendor lib from xsens, and wrote an cmake file to compile it
