    sprint1_Council_a -- refactored code from Python3 to Python2. Most work performed cleaned code of errors and syntactical mistakes.
    First commit
    Added BEPCPlayer as well as going over existing code. There were several cases where syntax wasn't satisfactory for pycharm and a couple of cases where a return statement was expected but not created in a function. The syntax should be (mostly) satisfactory and a couple of logic mistakes were corrected.
    Fixed player to be a class and updated methods
    Player class feature
    Changes were made to the directory previously and these changes caused an error when testing. This has been fixed by applying proper OO principles. There is still a bug in the Tournament.py class that has been noted in the class itself. It deals with a function that should return a value but when you return this value from the proper function, the match ends early while testing. PyCharm notes this line as being in error.

    Fixed errors in classes Message and Observable.
    Included a test driver for RPSPlayerExample (written as a

    Further modified Message module to use static methods within class Message
    instead of global functions.
