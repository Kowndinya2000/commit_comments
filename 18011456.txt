        dtbtool: Initial revision of table of device tree tool
    
        A tool to generate an image of table of device tree.  The image
        contains a header, table of device tree indices followed by the
        list of device tree blobs.
    
        Refer to dtbtool.txt for more information.

        dtbtool: Add support for array of ID's in qcom,msm-id tag
    
        Allow multiple chipset/platform/soc_rev triplets in
        qcom,msm-id tag.  This allows one DTS/DTB file to be used
        for multiple chipset/platform/soc_rev variants.
    
        Preliminary version - needs error handling in triplet
        parsing and general code cleanup.

    dtbtool: fix for filesystems that don't return d_type from readdir
    
    readdir() doesn't return d_type for all filesystems, in particular XFS
    doesn't fill in this field. fix by using stat() instead of d_type to
    determine if a dtb is a regular file. code is also rearranged slightly
    to avoid doing a redundant stat().

    dtbtool: simplify code. reducing indenting.
    
    this tidy is in preparation for adding a stat call
    instead of relying upon readdir.

    dtbtool: add new --dt_tag switch
    
    * Add new switch named --dt_tag (or -d)
    * Allows a custom QCDT_DT_TAG
    * If --dt_tag/-d is not used, it defaults to "qcom,msm-id =<" as it is today.
    
    This should allow more flexibility with devices requiring various DT_TAGs going forward.
