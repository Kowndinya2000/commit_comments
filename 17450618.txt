    [httperf] Fix Issue #43 - update config / build instructions.
    Update README.md
    
    This is not creating 1000 request, it creates 100 request (see the total)
    add intro to README (taken from google code site)
    rename README
    convert README to markdown
    Move everything into top-level directory.
    New build instructions regarding the construction of 0.9.1
    Adjusted README to reflect platform compatibilty
    Teach to use epoll(7) on httperf(1).
    Add AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR
    Move everything into top-level directory.
    Remove libevent port (for now)
    Make sure libevent check is properly quoted
    libevent is no longer optional
    idleconn is now built optionally with --enable-idleconn
    Enable dependancy on libevent.
    
    This will become the central event management tool in httperf
    Remove unused checks
    Remove useless portability checks for realloc and malloc.  If the system
    doesn't support these functions in a useful way then, I don't care...
    
    This just adds complexity
    Re-implemented timer code to fix memory leaks and use generic linked list
    Moved --enable-debug option code to near end of file to allow AC_PROG_CC to still update CFLAGS with -g -02
    Remove unnecessary openssl configuration checks
    configure.ac: Add configuration to use libevent
    configure.ac: Remove uneccessary configuration cruft and configure httperf to be built in c99 mode
    Version 0.9.99 preparing for 1.0.0
    Re-Added the getopt.c and getopt1.c to the build process
    httperf now compiles on Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD,  Solaris
    (with cc and gcc) and HP-UX 11i (with cc and gcc)
    Removed getopt.c and getopt1.c from build process
    
    httperf.c Wrapped call to getopt.h in pre-processor checks
    Using `AC_PROG_RANLIB' is rendered obsolete by `AC_PROG_LIBTOOL'
    Added third version level 0.9.0 from 0.9
    Move everything into top-level directory.
    Note Adrian Chadd as libevent port author
    Fixed memory leak associated with timers not being freed
    * man/httperf.1: Fixed man page typo for --wset option (needed --uri, not --wset)
    * man/httperf.1: New documentation regarding the variable periodic rates
    * src/httperf.c: New functionality for variable periodic rates
    * src/httperf.h: ditto
    * src/timer.c: ditto
    * AUTHORS: wsseslog crash fix was actually written by David Mosberger
    AUTHORS: Removed Durval Menezes from AUTHORS file since his fix
    has been re-written by Theodore Bullock
    Fix segfault when connection is failed by using epoll(7).
    Teach to use epoll(7) on httperf(1).
    make it compile with SSL 1.1.0
    Restore the original --server and --server_name options.
    Change --server to --servers.
    
    Prior to this commit --server took a list of servers, so making it
    plural makes sense.
    Add very numerous bug fixes and features, from Norse Corp.
    
    * Fix some corner cases with greedy mode, where ports would be
      tracked inside httperf rather than the OS.  There were handfuls
      of corner cases where it'd either loop over an already-allocated
      port by the OS and chew 100% of cpu with no progress. Also, hit an
      already allocated port by the OS, skip/stop, but then the next lookup
      would hit that port again - it would never find a new port to open.
    
    * Add kqueue support for FreeBSD. (No, not using libevent. Yet.)
    
    * Add a periodic stats option, to print out 200/302 counts once
      every second.  This is to aid in automatic scripts looking to graph
      the progress being made.
    
    * Add the ability to define multiple local client addresses, so
      requests can come from a much bigger pool of IP addresses.
      This allows for much more concurrency per process.)
    
    * Add an explicit timeout on how long httperf can run - again, to aid
      in automated testing.
    
    * Add an option to allow header contents to be loaded in from a file.
    
    * Other fixes, mostly type related fixes, thanks to clang/llvm on
      FreeBSD-10.
    
    We're using this in production at Norse to stress test out things,
    upwards of 25,000 requests per second per httperf process.
    Move everything into top-level directory.
    Remove the FD_SETSIZE check.
    
    This is a hold-over from using select() back in the past.
    It now uses libevent, so it no longer (itself) cares about the size of
    FD_SETSIZE.
    Remove libevent port (for now)
    The sys/types.h header is brought in via the generic_types.h header.  Adjust accordingly.
    Remove unused variables.
    Remove unused variables in core_loop()
    Bring over my initial libevent work into CVS.
    
    Tidyups of this stuff will follow.
    Remove spurious CRLFs from nohost blocks; fixes bug 1903551.
    Source formatting
    Removed silly realloc portability stuff

    structures to re-implement timers to use memory caching and
    try to fix memory leak associated with timers not being freed
    Fix minor oops (removed #include<string.h> erroneously)
    Cleaned many (not all) duplicate and hidden implicit #include directives from header and source files.  Header files should generally not include other header files
    lib/generic_types.h: New File - Migrate various generic types out of httperf.h in preparation for a generic queue data structure and other code cleanups
    * event.c and event.h: Moved to localevent.c and localevent.h for integration with libevent (which has a default header of event.h)
    Adjusted Free Software Foundation address to 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA

    Add support for Server Name Indication. Done during IETF 103 hackathon
    
    This patch adds support for SNI (Server Name Indication). The option
    --tls-server-name has been added in order to specify the server name
    to be used in the SeverName extension sent in the ClientHello for TLS
    connections. The newly added --tls-server-name option is optional:
    If not specified, httperf will simply function as usual by omitting
    the ServerName extension in the ClientHello for TLS connections.
    
    Closes: #47
    Signed-off-by: Muzaffar Auhammud <muzaffar@cyberstorm.mu>
    Stray line feed in fqdname causes --add-header and --add-header-file header records to be ignored by server.
    Restore the original --server and --server_name options.
    Change --server to --servers.
    
    Prior to this commit --server took a list of servers, so making it

    Use correct ifdefs for checking TLS 1.3
    
    TLS 1.3 is not ready yet in LibreSSL. Also there is a theoretical
    possibility of OpenSSL >=1.1.1 built without TLS 1.3 support
    Add support for Server Name Indication. Done during IETF 103 hackathon
    
    This patch adds support for SNI (Server Name Indication). The option
    --tls-server-name has been added in order to specify the server name
    to be used in the SeverName extension sent in the ClientHello for TLS
    connections. The newly added --tls-server-name option is optional:
    If not specified, httperf will simply function as usual by omitting
    the ServerName extension in the ClientHello for TLS connections.
    
    Closes: #47
    Signed-off-by: Muzaffar Auhammud <muzaffar@cyberstorm.mu>
    Add missing 'case' statement that causes TLSv1.3 implementation to be unreachable.
    Remove extra 'break;' that prevent SSL_CTX_set_options from being set
    Fix a bug that ignored the --ssl-protocol parameter
    Implement support for TLSv1.3 in OpenSSL >= 1.1.1
    Implement specific support for TLSv1.2
    Implement specific support for TLSv1.1
    Make TLSv1 use TLSv1.0 specifically to prevent ambiguity with TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2, TLSv1.3
    Use the new API for SSLv3 protocol selection in OpenSSL >= 1.1.0
    Make conditional compilation for SSLv2 future proof and backwards compatible with OpenSSL <= 1.1.0
    Add more flexibility in choice of protocol for TLSv1.x
    Remove the TLS 1.3 implementation which fails specifically on OpenSSL 1.1.0
    Optimize OpenSSL initialization by removing synonymous calls to SSL_library_init()
    Enable use of TLS 1.3. Done during IETF 101 hackathon.
    Restore the original --server and --server_name options.
    Change --server to --servers.
    
    Prior to this commit --server took a list of servers, so making it
    plural makes sense.
    Fix building when OpenSSL was compiled -nossl2  or -noss3
    
    This also fixes building with LibreSSL 2.2 (no SSLv2) and 2.3 (no SSLv3)
    Reroll No-SSLv3 patch/Add No-SSLv2 patch
    apply https://github.com/httperf/httperf/issues/8 patch from rowan.li...@gmail.com
    Add very numerous bug fixes and features, from Norse Corp.
    
    * Fix some corner cases with greedy mode, where ports would be
      tracked inside httperf rather than the OS.  There were handfuls
      of corner cases where it'd either loop over an already-allocated
      port by the OS and chew 100% of cpu with no progress. Also, hit an
      already allocated port by the OS, skip/stop, but then the next lookup
      would hit that port again - it would never find a new port to open.
    
    * Add kqueue support for FreeBSD. (No, not using libevent. Yet.)
    
    * Add a periodic stats option, to print out 200/302 counts once
      every second.  This is to aid in automatic scripts looking to graph
      the progress being made.
    
    * Add the ability to define multiple local client addresses, so
      requests can come from a much bigger pool of IP addresses.
      This allows for much more concurrency per process.)
    
    * Add an explicit timeout on how long httperf can run - again, to aid
      in automated testing.
    
    * Add an option to allow header contents to be loaded in from a file.
    
    * Other fixes, mostly type related fixes, thanks to clang/llvm on
      FreeBSD-10.
    
    We're using this in production at Norse to stress test out things,
    upwards of 25,000 requests per second per httperf process.
    Move everything into top-level directory.

    Remove libevent port (for now)
    The sys/types.h header is brought in via the generic_types.h header.  Adjust accordingly.
    Bring over my initial libevent work into CVS.
    
    Tidyups of this stuff will follow.
    timer.c and timer.h: Use new heap and queue data
    structures to re-implement timers to use memory caching and
    try to fix memory leak associated with timers not being freed
    Cleaned many (not all) duplicate and hidden implicit #include directives from header and source files.  Header files should generally not include other header files
    lib/generic_types.h: New File - Migrate various generic types out of httperf.h in preparation for a generic queue data structure and other code cleanups
    * event.c and event.h: Moved to localevent.c and localevent.h for integration with libevent (which has a default header of event.h)

    Copyright 2000-2007 Hewlett-Packard Company
    * *.c and *.h: Slightly adjusted license to explicitly point out AUTHORS file as official list of authors
    changed a sprintf call to the more secure snprintf
    Updated License with linking exception for the openssl project
    Add very numerous bug fixes and features, from Norse Corp.
    
    * Fix some corner cases with greedy mode, where ports would be
      tracked inside httperf rather than the OS.  There were handfuls
      of corner cases where it'd either loop over an already-allocated
      port by the OS and chew 100% of cpu with no progress. Also, hit an
      already allocated port by the OS, skip/stop, but then the next lookup
      would hit that port again - it would never find a new port to open.
    
    * Add kqueue support for FreeBSD. (No, not using libevent. Yet.)
    
    * Add a periodic stats option, to print out 200/302 counts once
      every second.  This is to aid in automatic scripts looking to graph
      the progress being made.
    
    * Add the ability to define multiple local client addresses, so
      requests can come from a much bigger pool of IP addresses.
      This allows for much more concurrency per process.)
    
    * Add an explicit timeout on how long httperf can run - again, to aid
      in automated testing.
    
    * Add an option to allow header contents to be loaded in from a file.
    
    * Other fixes, mostly type related fixes, thanks to clang/llvm on
      FreeBSD-10.
    
    We're using this in production at Norse to stress test out things,
    upwards of 25,000 requests per second per httperf process.
    Move everything into top-level directory.
