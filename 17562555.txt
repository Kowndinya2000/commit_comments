    refs #56439 - consolidate migrations
    
    Although I know it's not best practice to do this, errors in change_field_in_fae_text_fields (rename_column also renames the index in Rails >= 4.2) motivated this commit. Since Fae does not yet have widespread adoption, I think this change can be absorbed without consequences. The Rails engine only copies in new files, and this commit does not rename any existing files.
    
    Fae versions < 1.1 should be upgraded to v1.1 and run `rake fae:install:migrations` before upgrading to > 1.1 as this commit consolidates the language feature migration (8150a84).

    Although I know it's not best practice to do this, errors in change_field_in_fae_text_fields (rename_column also renames the index in Rails >= 4.2) motivated this commit. Since Fae does not yet have widespread adoption, I think this change can be absorbed without consequences. The Rails engine only copies in new files, and this commit does not rename any existing files.

    Fixes #240 - Add I18n support for admin interface
    
    This adds the possibility of having admin iterface
    translated. The language is chosen based
    on the language of the user that is currently
    logged in. If no user is logged in,
    the default is English.
    
    Note that this does not interfere with the actual

    Changing default unselected option from Select One to None
    Fixes #240 - Add I18n support for admin interface
    
    This adds the possibility of having admin iterface
    translated. The language is chosen based
    on the language of the user that is currently
    logged in. If no user is logged in,
    the default is English.
    
    Note that this does not interfere with the actual
    language of the site when the site ApplicationController
    sets the locale from params as usual.
    
    I added the translations for Czech.

    adds Rails versions to dummy migrations
    Fixes #240 - Add I18n support for admin interface
    
    This adds the possibility of having admin iterface
    translated. The language is chosen based
    on the language of the user that is currently
    logged in. If no user is logged in,
    the default is English.
    
    Note that this does not interfere with the actual
    language of the site when the site ApplicationController
    sets the locale from params as usual.

    remove outdated crop feature
    
    Since we're not actively supporting this feature, it should be removed. Otherwise, it's just cruft and misleading.
    
    This commit can be reversed if we eventually want to support crop, but reverter be aware - jcrop.js will need to be replaced or readded

    This adds the possibility of having admin iterface
    translated. The language is chosen based
    on the language of the user that is currently
    logged in. If no user is logged in,
    the default is English.
    
    Note that this does not interfere with the actual
    language of the site when the site ApplicationController
    sets the locale from params as usual.
