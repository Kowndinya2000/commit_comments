    Overhaul of alert template
    
    The two ideas are that it should almost work out of the box and that it should
    be really easy to drop something cool in. I also wanted to demonstrate both
    app-level attributes and alert-level attributes, so I put the title at the app
    level and the message at the action level.  In the action I built a template
    to safe_substitute in any alert properties, so a message can be written with
    variable like $source and they will get substituted in the message.
    
    For demo purposes, replacing the two writes to stderr with something
    substantive will allow a real action to take place.  I've been using this to
    pop up an alert on OSX.  Seems to work well.
    
    applescript = 'display notification "{}" with title "{}"'.format(message_text, title);
    call(["osascript", "-e", applescript])
    Document logging and input for custom alert template
    
    Added simple map to the JSON structure that the script is called
    with, and a description for how logging should work when the script
    is called.

    Changed labels on dendogram
    
    Label was being set by innerHtml (via d3's .html) which Safari doesn't support in SVG.  I couldn't make sense of the numbers, so I reduced the label to be name (document accesses) and moved an explanation (and the number of subgroups) to a tooltip.  Also renamed 'sum' to 'total_accesses' in the data structure, as it took me a while to answer 'sum of what?'
