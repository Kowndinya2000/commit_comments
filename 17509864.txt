    use generic opencv/opencv4 support from base/cmake
    move project() call at toplevel (bumps CMake compatibility to 3.9)
    add optional compatibility with opencv 4
    Update to use rock cmake macros
    
    This avoids a problem with opencv3.0.0
    
    Conflicts:
            CMakeLists.txt
            src/CMakeLists.txt
    CV seems cause problem, fixed build that opencv does not get linked correctly
    Added auto exposure and auto whitebalance functions
    added doxygen support
