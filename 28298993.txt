    Add Ruby 2.1.2 to the README
    Clarifies where to find the releases
    
    Resolves issue #644
    Update README.md
    
    Other boxem fixed.
    Moved Upgrading instructions to FAQ
    Added boxen upgrade instructions
    Fix to support LLVM/ruby that ships with Xcode 5.1
    Suggest some example hierarchies
    Mention the default hiera configuration in README
    fixed the rubies list
    added note about clang error and workaround
    Update README.md
    
    I found a superfluous space, and also because you are _in_ the directories you need to `./script/boxen` each time.
    OSX -> OS X
    update XCode instructions re: boxen-web
    add xcode instructions for mavericks
    Clarify the installation steps after bootstrapping
    
    Make it clearer on how to install a boxen from the command line after the
    bootstrapping steps are done.
    Clarify where to create the new git repo.
    
    Be more explicit about where the new repo should be located. It's much
    easier to set up a repo on the internet. This was implied before and now
    it's explicit.
    
    The first time I helped a colleague set this up, we used a local repo.
    Since we didn't know what we were doing, we screwed it up pretty badly.
    This bit of text might allow others not to make the same mistake we did.
    Add Node 0.10
    Node.js v0.4 no longer provided by default
    
    as of 2fc3983825
    Add Ruby 2.0.0 to README
    
    It's provided now.
    Formatting
    Update puppet-inifile location in readme
    Fix typo: 1.0.5 -> 1.1.0
    
    Code says `github "java",     "1.1.0"`, but documentation says "1.0.5", so I fixed it.
    Put a space in this
    adding docs for Github Enterprise users
    Some readme consistency
    Update to chown staff to be consistent with script.sh. Fixes #152.
    Update nodejs version in readme
    update puppetfile and readme to latest versions
    Minor grammatical edit
    
    I think in this case "bootstrap" is already a verb.
    No hard drive encryption
    
    Some users may not want to encrypt their hard drive, so make
    sure they know the option exists to not have to encrypt their
    hard drive.
    Updates README
    
    Noticed that Boxen won't run people/manifests/user-name.pp if it
    includes dash
    Update README

    halp!
    Update README.md including module documentation
    
    The README.md has more detailed instructions on how to include modules from Github by editing your Puppetfile and site.pp files.
    Add opt dir instructions
    
    Add missing instructions that will affect the shell config.
    XCode → Xcode
    
    We of all people should care about how to capitalize something properly.
    relativize documentation links
    minor cleanup
    
    Fix typos.
    Clarify module includes in the Puppetfile.
    README for boxen-web
    add docs about how to have members of your org set things up
    README tweaks
    Update README.md for @wfarr's changes
    
    Based on the feedback in the Pull request <https://github.com/boxen/our-boxen/pull/12>,
    this commit implements changes to clarify how someone would customize
    their Boxen setup.
    Add note about agreeing to XCode license.
    Update git command in README
    
    Even though a lot of people setup `git co`, it's not available on a fresh install. Makes copy-pasta for creating my-boxen easier.
    Update README.md according to style
    
    Previously, the README.md file was updated but didn't match existing
    Github style. This commit wraps near 80 columns (markdown links make
    that a bit harder) and eliminate unnecessary steps (linking to
    existing documentation and removing redundant declarations).
    Update README
    
    Previously, documentation around creating modules and using site.pp
    was pretty slim. This commit adds more documentation and links to
    Puppet's documentation site.

    Bump to puppet-gcc 2.2.1 and puppet-git 2.4.0
    
    Fixes for the following problems:
    * The latest Xcode installs git 2.4.0 and brew fails when trying to
      downgrade.
    * The latest Xcode breaks bootstrap by not stripping binaries. A
      workaround is implemented in the latest puppet-gcc release.

    Rename `module-data` to `module_data`
    
    This came up in rodjek/librarian-puppet#242. A `-` is not a valid
    character in module names according to
    http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/latest/reference/modules_fundamentals.html#allowed-module-names
    In the Modulefile for ripienaar/puppet-module-data, the name actually
    contains an underscore.

    Revert to puppet-go 1.1.0
    
    This upgrade to 2.0.1 was overlooked when I merged #519, and breaks

    required for someone.
    
    See https://github.com/boxen/our-boxen/pull/311#issuecomment-19719152
    Set the global node version in the site manifest
    Use the boxen-git-credential for all repositories clones.
    
    This is required since puppet run all the comands as root and the
    credential config is only present on the user land.
    
    The lack of this configuration is making clones using https to not
    work since the credential is not present for the root.

    Speed up bootstrap by using checksums
    
    We've been using this modified bootstrap here at GitHub for months. I've
    neglected to extract it to the public repo, until now.
    
    This uses a quick checksum of `Gemfile`, `Gemfile.lock`, binstubs, the
    ruby version and bundler version to determine if bundling is
    necessary. This is much, much faster than running bundler every time.
    
    I've also included some of our other misc. changes, mainly to logging
    output and some minor structural pieces.

    Suppressing error message when CLTools not installed
    
    On Mavericks you can install full Xcode and Boxen, but then you get this line every time you run `boxen` on the command-line:
    
        No receipt for 'com.apple.pkg.CLTools_Executables' found at '/'.
    
    This minor bugfix suppresses the message.

    updated git credential to use git command
    
      * on a new os x install git-credential-osxkeychain is not a valid command
        so we should rely on the git subcommand instead which is just git credential-osxkeychain
      * this was an oversight because once boxen runs it installs this command as /usr/local/bin/git-credential-osxkeychain.
    boxen-git-credential: handle /usr/local Homebrew.
    
    Don't assume the Git credential location as Homebrew might be in
    /usr/local and due to Boxen being Boxen we can't get the location in
    this script itself (as far as I can tell).
    
    Closes #727.
    Fix for git credentials containing an '=' sign
    
    Thanks @dbussink
    Short term hack to unbreak boxen-git-credential on 10.8 systems

    script/sync: don't print skip message if object exists.
    
    This avoids wasting time trying to fix up Homebrew formulae that are
    already uploaded.
    script/sync: handle custom homebrew roots.
    
    Upload binaries to a sensible location depending on the Homebrew root.
    
    Also, ensure that all old binaries are still used correctly and don't
    try to reupload binaries for stuff already bottled by Homebrew.
    script/sync: set boxen bucket by default.
    
    We do this elsewhere so let's be consistent.

    Update sync script to the latest from @dgoodlad
    
    As gisted at https://gist.github.com/dgoodlad/34f429d1b84a471933d3, and
    linked from https://github.com/boxen/puppet-homebrew/issues/60, this is
    the latest sync script used by Github's our-boxen. It uses the newer
    aws-sdk-core gem, and apparently actually works.

    It's cleaner to have another case: "not on any branch".
    Don't die if HEAD ref is not symbolic.
    
    Examples of situations when HEAD is not symbolic:

    speed up all invocations of boxen
    
    when running Bundler, it just so happens that --local should (but does not)
    skip updating the gems in vendor/cache. explicitly skipping that update drops
    most of a second off of every run of boxen.
