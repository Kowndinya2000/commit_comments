    Added notification icons with dark background to fix contrast in Android 2.x and 3.x
    Notification improvements:
    - use NotificationCompat.Builder from the support library and remove the custom progressbar layout; this will give platform users the expected look and feel of a notificati
    - remove OCNotificationManager (it contained the old layout references, but was unused)
    - add new notification icons that follow the Android style guidelines (http://developer.android.com/design/style/iconography.html#notification)
