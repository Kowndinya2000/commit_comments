    Add method error() to retrieve error sent by Twitter
    Move code to get access token inside check
    
    otherwise you will get an exception if the user answers the cancels the oauth flow.
    Fix route for unsuccessful login
    
    If login is not successful you should be redirected to the error page, not the login route that redirects you somewhere else again.
    Add documentation on all available functionality
    
    ... by copy/pasting the (excellent) inline code documentation in a proper list.
    give examples their own routes
    
    ... so new users can just copy paste them to their web.php and try it without changing anything.
    Fix reference to include_email param
    add Get Credentials with Email to Readme.md
    Change publish command so it only publishes the package files
    
    By using the --provider option on the vendor:publish command we can indicate the Service Provider for which we want configuration files to be published, avoiding publish files from other packages that the user might or might not want.
    Fixed Typo
    
    Fixed a typo in the documentation that I have added.

    Add method error() to retrieve error sent by Twitter
    Change important API updates
    
    Use the Twitter publish resource for oEmbed requests, because it is not rate limited and add important documentation on some parameters for Tweet-retrieval (Tweets are truncated by default now).
    Changed exceptions to be more specific ones provided by PHP's SPL.

    Fix logic check for required parameters in some of the list API methods
    getListsStatuses bug: list_id or slug
    
    getListsStatuses was throwing exception when list_id parameter was missing, even if slug paramter was specified
    update param checks for getListMembers
    update param checks for getList
    update param checks for getListMembers
    Fix valid parameter checks
    
    lists/show and lists/subscribers can accept a list_id OR and slug. Both parameters should not exist for the method to throw an exception.
    
    Probably needs fixing for other methods as well.
    Update Twitter.php
    
    Two new methods to compose the 'retweet' and the 'add to favorites' links.
    Fixed regex to allow all characters
    
    Now works with Swedish chars and with cyrillic
    Properly corrects regex for hastags
    
    Updated hash linkify function to properly linkify cyrillic and Swedish characters.
    
    Fixes issue #23
    Remove references to ->http_code from the code.
    Replace call to the parent's function to reconfigure Twitter class with Twitter's set_new_config.
    This allows the getAccessToken function to replace the request token
    with the user's token, which should be used from now on on all the calls.
    Add new functions to Twitter class allowing to implement
    'Sign in with Twitter' option. Also allow the use of
    multiple tokens with the library.

    Update getUsers() and getUsersLookup()
    Update getUsers() and getUsersLookup()
    Added 'users/lookup' helper method and more tests.
    
    First, the twitter spec requires that 'users/show' have a parameter
    named `user_id`, not just `id`.
    
    Second, added a new sugar method `#getUsersLookup` which maps to
    `users/lookup`, as well as tests.
    
    Third, added a new testcase for both `#getUsers()` and
    `#getUsersLookup()` that ensures that an exception is thrown when
    required parameters are not present.
    Fixed Twitter#getUsers() and added a test
    
    `Twitter#users()` previously threw an error if you passed either a
    `screen_name` or an `id`. According to the Twitter API spec, you can
    pass either a `screen_name` or an `id`.
    
    I added a test that ensures that both strategies get appropriately
    passed to the #query method.
    Now extends themattharris/tmhOAuth due to connexion problems while uploading images
    Fixed POSTFIELDS
    Added linkify method for parsing links in a tweet
