    Experimental stuff for GreenCOM paper
    Experimental stuff for GreenCOM paper
    Modified the behavior of frequency going up:
    
    Before:
       - Freqs were instantaneously going up to freq max
    Now:
       - Freqs are going up as fast as going down
    
    This implies some overhead when sudden cpu-bound phases, but saves
    energy (by a lot) for volatile cpu phases.
    
    Future work:
    Introduce an hybrid solution that consists in evaluating a "consensus"
    decision between low and high freqs in order to keep energy savings
    without compromising execution time
    Fixed several bugs and implemented the 100ms waiting time
    Fixed the cpu activity bug

    Version with L3MissRatio phase change detection
    Version with IPS phase change detection
    Experimental stuff for GreenCOM paper
    Modified the behavior of frequency going up:
    
    Before:
       - Freqs were instantaneously going up to freq max
    Now:
       - Freqs are going up as fast as going down
    
    This implies some overhead when sudden cpu-bound phases, but saves
    energy (by a lot) for volatile cpu phases.
    
    Future work:
    Introduce an hybrid solution that consists in evaluating a "consensus"
    decision between low and high freqs in order to keep energy savings
    without compromising execution time
    - Fixed energy performance to achieve the same as IGCC tag commit
    - added a smoothIPC method to prevent measurement noise
    - Commented, cleared the refactored code
    Fixed the max ipc computation by reseting values
    fixing debug log
    fixing debug log
    Fixed several bugs and implemented the 100ms waiting time
    - Fixed the wrong Pref
    - Fixed the freqsToEvaluate set iterators
    - Removed useless methods in FreqSelector (getBestFrequency,
      getFrequencyMark)
    - Fixed the stability bug (because we did not take the good hwc_
      structure in
      Thread.h)
    Fixed the cpu activity bug
    - Still have to fix the stability bug
    Fixed the atexit call and signal handling bug
    Fixed the nbFreqs bug in DecisionMaker
    Fixed the hwcPanic bug in evaluateFrequency
    Fixed Thread.h's reset method (compilation error)
    - Add of a function to reset HW counters in Thread.h
    - Explitited the dependencies between function members in Thread.h
    Forgot to add the Src folder... won't work without this commit
    Fixed a compilation issue: Forgot to push a source file... *sigh*
    - Added a XeonPhi-specific configuration file
    - Active core checking is now done before the evaluation
    - XeonPhi TSC clock variance now handled in offline
    - Thread class now is aware of its corresponding DVFSUnit
    - Code cleaning
    - Fixed the restablishment of the governors on Xeon Phi
    - Removed useless file openings on Xeon Phi
    This is because there is a software correlation in cpufreq's sysfs
    involving all the cards' threads
    Deleted Hand-over message when FoREST quits
    Fixed the Makefile rules to build and clean-up properly
    Bug update:
    - Removed PythonForMIC as a subproject
    - Rewritten Offline phase in C++
    - Fixed a bug that caused crashed at exit
    First release with Xeon Phi support (beta)
    Deleted PathBuilder and PathCache classes, added a FileUtils static
    class instead.

    Test empty git repo
    Fixed several bugs and implemented the 100ms waiting time
    DecisionMaker in DVFSUnit is now dynamically allocated to have the
    threads vector as a constructor parameter
    - Removed the Config object from topology (now created in main)
    - Config passed throuh Topology --> DVFSUnit --> DecisionMaker
    - Renamed LocalRest.[cpp/h] --> FoREST.[cpp/h]
    - Removed the useless ThreadArgs structure
    - Context now only consists of : ThreadContext vector, config and
      topology objects)
    - ThreadContext only consists of : DVFSUnit pointer and pthread_t variable
    - Added FoREST namespace in the Logger class
    - Added using namespace FoREST in the main (FoREST.cpp) file
    - Removed ThreadContexts from Topology and DVFSUnit classes

    (see https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=58761)
    Deleted PathBuilder and PathCache classes, added a FileUtils static
    class instead.
