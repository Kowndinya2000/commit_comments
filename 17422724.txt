    Inital commit to the LaserFilter library
    
    This commit adds two (tested) filters:
    The NoiseFilter is a filter on incline between scan readings.
    It is good for filtering noise from 'jumpy edgeds' that occure
    if one scans over a corner of an object.
    
    The BoxFilter transforms the given laserscan into an pointcloud
    and removes any point that is inside of the given bounding boxes.
